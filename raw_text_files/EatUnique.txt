The vegetarian muffuletta was essentially an olive salad melt. It was pretty oily but very tasty. Love the bread! The cookie was big and decadent - a matcha cookie with white choc chips topped with matcha frosting  - I would've considered it complete without the frosting but the frosting was still a treat! The cookie was nice and soft with a pleasant matcha flavour. The tea was very good too. The prices are definitely fair - I found the food very filling and the quality was great.There's lots of seating inside the shop if you want to dine in, and the place is comfortable.

It's a nice option when you are looking for lunch with a variety of things to order and some healthy choices. The white turkey chili is my go to order. And they also have delicious unhealthy food choices, like their homemade desserts. The downside is that the establishment gets my order wrong about 70% of the time. Whether our office calls to order over the phone or I walk in to place my order, consistently something is not correct. Everything is also very chaotic and hectic during lunch. The design of the space is not suited for the type of business where so many people get things to go and there is no comfortable room to wait for your order to be called when it's busy. Most of the staff doesn't seem to know what's in the items or how they are served but they will ask to find out sometimes, and other times they just take a guess and that's that.

Their food tastes fresh and I really like their bread! I heard they have pretty good dessert but I'm Lenting off sweets so I have to come back next time to try and review them! Their service was pretty quick and the staff was friendly both times. The atmosphere is really chill and quiet so it's a nice spot to get work done AND they have free WiFi which is a plus!

I just ate the lemon almond cookie and it was the right amount of sweet and soooo soft. I cannot wait to try the lemon bar when I get home. The interior wasn't anything special.

Everyone else seemed as though they liked it more than I did, and I resented the frequency with which people would suggest it for lunch.

"The sandwiches are quite small," I\'d thrown in, pointedly.)But towards the end of my time there, I found myself craving the various delicious soups and going there on *gasp* my own.

The employee have always been very nice as well.', 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "I'm not trying to knock this place in any way, but I was not impressed at all.  First off, I did not dine in here, I called in an order and stopped to pick it up.  The space itself is unique, very colorful, and definitely not like any other place I have been in the city.  The order I called in was a rather larger order so I expected that there would be a little wait.  When I showed up on Craig St. I was surprised to find a nearby street parking space and not have to circle several times.  But that did not matter, my order still wasn't even started by the time that I was quoted the order to be ready.  Then add into that the fact that when I called in the order and by the time they started to prepare the order, the soup of the day was out.  So instead of setting aside the soup for our order, they sold it to someone that ordered after us.  To say the girl that was running the register was frazzled is an understatement.  She literally was running around.  I think that she was new or inexperienced, and that was unsettling.  Especially when she went to make a cappuccino and didn't know how to steam the milk or how to pour the milk into the espresso.  Then when it came to getting the orders comprised and ready to go, my order was split between another lady's order.  Even though I was being rushed to leave and make space at the counter I'm glad I looked at my order before I left.  Why?  Because it still wasn't correct.Anyway, enough with that, let's talk about the food.  I ordered the Spicy Grilled Cheese and Bacon with a small bowl of Cream of Tomato with Feta and Basil.  The grilled cheese was definitely the star of the day.  The soup on the other hand was extremely salty and I could not finish it.  To sum it up, This place really did make eating unique, and not in a good way.", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "I'm going to tell you right now, I was doing UberEats with the family one day and we all got different things and I know my mother doesn't like to eat out too much (she's a NON-GMO fanatic) so I found this place.

I enjoyed my food there and I was served quickly. The only thing that sort of bothered me was the fact that the service didn\'t seem to even know what was on the menu or what I was ordering when I asked questions. At first, I thought it was just my order, but someone else came in right after me and asked some questions and also got the same blank stare and "I don\'t know" response. I got a grilled veggie wrap and it was decent. A little greasy (but I was expecting that from a deli style place like this) but it was satisfying enough to make a dinner out of.  It looked like their baked goods were pretty popular (saw a few vegan things which was nice!) but I didn\'t get the chance to try any. Like I said, for a college town, this is a pretty great place to eat. I\'d also imagine it was a really nice place to study as well.

Super great service and staff and absolutely wonderful food! It's my favorite place to get lunch when I'm down in Oakland.

Their soups are all pretty solid choices; I highly recommend either the tomato feta basil or chicken florentine! I normally get the half-sandwich/half-soup combo, but their sandwich options for the combo are pretty limited. Their chicken pesto sandwich is decent, but it can get pricey especially if you get it with a soup.The biggest downside I can think of is the inconsistency in wait time. Depending on how many people ordered and how many people called in, the wait can take anywhere from 5 to 30 minutes. The layout of the place is also a bit weird; you can't really hear the number of your order from the tables, so many people crowd by the counter where food comes out, which is right next to the cashier. As a result, it gets super crowded around an already small area. Everything's great once you get your food, but the ordering and waiting process can definitely be refined.", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': 'Food here is very good.  Each item is made fresh as you order and they are very organized.  Sandwiches, soups and salads are all delicious!', 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': 'My only regret about this place is that I never came here when I was a student. It was so good!Yes, the check-out space wasn\'t designed very well and often results in human traffic jams. Yes, the food costs more than you\'d want it to here. But c\'mon: EVERY place costs more than I want it to, and as someone else pointed out: Eat Unique\'s prices compare to Panera\'s, only Eat Unique\'s food tastes even better (and I say this as a solid Panera fan). There\'s a ton of seating options in here, too, so before you complain, just think about how many fewer tables there may have been if they knocked out a wall to try and expand the line area.I had the Grilled Pesto Chicken sandwich during my first visit in an effort to avoid some of the "unhealthier" options on the menu and have to say, I was very, very pleased. It\'s very rare that I get a sandwich that perfectly balances toppings and meat; usually I get too much of one or the other. Plus, the toppings were crisp and fresh, and the chicken well cooked. Not the juiciest chicken ever but not dry by any means. It was right on, it hit the spot, and it left me feeling satisfied and yet ready for more. Don\'t worry: I was good and opted to keep the place in mind for another day, rather than pig out on a second sandwich.

I wait for the bus by Eat Unique so I figured I would test it out.I ordered a spicy grilled cheese ($5.99 w tax).  I think it had pepper jack and cheddar cheese, tomato, and banana peppers.  There was supposed to be bacon, but it was either a negligible amount or they forgot it.  Maybe I was starving, but this sandwich was great.  I really loved the combination and the price is so fair.

However, it also deterred me from going to the Strip to get it, so I decided to head down the street instead to Eat Unique.I must admit that after having picked up an unimpressive sandwich (don't remember which) from here a couple of years ago before a trip, I'd been hesitant to patronize this place again.  Having reviewed other Yelpers' comments, I decided to opt for a small tomato basil feta soup and the pesto chicken sandwich, which came to slightly over $10 together.  Because I went today (Sat.), it wasn't very busy, and I didn't encounter any confusion or hostility when ordering.  After ordering, my food took about 5 min. to prepare. Since I live nearby, I took it back to my apt. to consume.The tomato soup, which was reasonably warm, although not quite as hot as I'd like it, was pretty good, albeit not mind-blowing.  The sandwich was solidly okay, and not as flavorful as I would have liked, esp. for something containing pesto.  Although it stayed together fairly well, the ingredients slid around a fair bit, and it cooled off pretty quickly, to the point that I put the second half in the microwave before eating it.While the food was solidly okay, esp. for deli food in PGH, I've had better.

I'm fairly certain their soup is made from scratch daily. I can't give Eat Unique five stars because every time I go there for lunch I'm under extreme duress.

What stunned me was the portion size. As you can see in the picture, the "small soup" I ordered is BIGGER than my sandwich. Inside my sandwich included ONE slice of tomato,ONE slice of Mozzarella cheese, and 1/4 of a cup of lettuce. If I am going to be charged extra for gluten free, make the inside of the sandwich the equivalent of a regular sandwich. COMPLETE RIPOFF.

I ended up taking my chili home, and it tastes just as yummy when microwaved a few hours later!The chicken pesto sandwhich was absolutely wonderful.  I\'m not big on vegetables or pesto that tastes what I call too "green", so this pesto was really good.  Not too raw tasting.  The chicken was really good and fresh.  I really liked the bread that the sandwich is made on, but not quite sure what the name of it is.

In reality I don't think a heaping portion of gauc, sour cream and cheese added up to zero calories.
