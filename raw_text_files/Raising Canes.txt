[{'review_text': "Hey I was really impressed with this Raising Cane's in Oakland/PITT for the AWESOME customer service alone. It was a packed house on a Wednesday at 11:30 PM. First off, I like that Cane's stays open late. The staff was upbeat; positive energy; friendly; even though it was packed house busy haha. What can we say, PGH loves fried CHKN. What about the food right?  Okay...I ordered the CANIAC. YUM. It comes with 6 fresh n' fried to perfection crispy CHKN tenders, crinkle-cut fries w/ a tasty light-salt seasoning, two signature; addicting & finger lick'n good Cane's sauces, some Texas toast, coleslaw & a large fountain drink. Do yourself a favor and get the fresh squeezed lemonade or even the tea! (Size large/PLUS) This was my first time at Cane's. I was hooked at first sip; love the ice cubes too.  My meal came out fresh n' hot! The CHKN tenders are fried to a light crisp which also gets you hooked & wanting more. Don't forget Cane's dipping sauce n' grab XTRa as it really brings out the flavor & meal together as a whole. If you can order ahead online or mobile, do so!  Oh the ambiance is pretty decked out too!", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': 'Canes is some yum chicken fingers is it wait on a line worthy no its not but if there is no line then go on in packed with teenagers and such they are oblivious to how loud and how rude they can beorder is easy the people working there are super friendly and nice and welcomingthe fingers tasty their sauce tasty  the buttery Texas toast is worth getting. the fries are just crinkle cuts tasty enoughslaw was just slaw I am happy with just the fingers the toast and the sauce for a savory satisfying mealThey also have fresh squeezed lemonade and soda drinksfresh hot chicken and your name is what they yell when its doneThey are open late till midnight so if your hungry go get some chicken about 15 for the full meal you see in my picture of course this is Oakland metered parking is a problem late night not such a problem', 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "I don't typically review fast food venues however...My youngest son and I stopped by on Thanksgiving Eve.  We've eaten at Canes in Ohio before so we knew what to expect.Pitt had a sporting event that night and Canes was pretty busy.  Regardless we were able to order and received our food in 10-15 minutes. We both had four piece tenders with extra fries instead of slaw and bread.  The canes sauce is the difference maker here.  It is fantastic.Overall the venue was clean, workers seemed friendly and efficient.  I enjoyed my visit and Canes is definitely a solid option for chicken.", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "A little torn on this one. After the hype was maybe expecting more.  Chicken was tender but could use more flavor... but I don't generally use sauces and people seem to rave about out the sauce so maybe that's my problem. I enjoy a good crinkle cut fry, so that was a positive. Fountain soda they give you a cup packed to the brim with ice so it was kind of like drinking a slushy...Texas toast was thick but kind of meh for me. Lines were long but with such a limited menu it actually moved very fast. The real problem here is finding parking. We ended up parking two blocks away in a garage. Probably wouldn't do that again, but we wanted to try something new.", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "We were excited for Raising Canes to open. My cousins in OH always rave about it. Now I see why. I'll start with the service and cleanliness of the restaurant. For only being open a few weeks, they're super efficient. There was a long line but it went fast. The ladies at the counter let you know they're open and to come down. They're patient when you're new explaining options and make ordering efficient. You also don't wait a crazy long time considering all the people waiting. They also have multiple people watching for people to finish and have wet wipes to wipe down the tables and chairs. Fantastic service!The food was really good. It was well seasoned and flavorful. They were big pieces of chicken too. We all really enjoyed it and will be back again.", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "Canes is one of my favorite fast food chains, I'm so glad it made its way to Pittsburgh. My wife and I went on the second day it opened. Although the line was out the door, it went by very fast and we got our food quick. As always, everything was amazing. The decor is pretty cool too, Pittsburgh themed.", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "I love Raising Canes!  And I know that this is the hot new restaurant in Oakland in the middle of a college campus. I ordered my food on the app before I got there. Arrived at the restaurant a few minutes e before my order was due to be ready. It was packed. I stood over to the side patiently waiting for my food. 35 minutes went by. I watched as people who came in a good bit after me stood in line, ordered, and received their food. Finally after about a 40 minute wait, my order was ready. I'll chalk it up to being new. But remember that this is a location with no parking and no drive through. It's tough. The manager, Jake, was very nice and was apologetic multiple times as I waited   I'll be back again. Hopefully next time will be a bit quicker.", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "Stopped at Gussy's but it was closed for maintenance.  Notice a short line at Raising Canes.  It did take awhile.  The combo box was good.  Typical RC's moist and tasty chicken fingers, good slaw, and Texas toast.  The fries aren't so hot but dip them in the Cane's sauce and somehow they are OK.", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "Raising canes is a chihicken finger joint that has picked up a lot of fans across America. ( I HAVE NO idea why! ) I saw them hyped up on TicTok... One Raising  Canes opened I. PITTSBURGH OAKLAND AERA in the college part of town, there was a line out the door down the street and around the corner full of college students. I WAITED A WEEK BEFORE I TRIED TO ENTER. I finally got the chance to try this place out. One of the other reasons is that my youngest daughter said it was good. This place has an armed police officer at the door, although nice it doesn't seem to need one. It's been a week, and the kids are still crowded in the place. The food was mid at best, an average chicken finger joint, the seasoning was not consistent with the product, meaning one chicken finger was loaded with it, and the other was not. The sauce was a bit above average, not much. The fries are butt stank boring, and the garlic bread was average, not much butter. My daughter told me to get it buttered on both sides. I forgot to do that.Raising Canes is not worth a special trip. But if you're near one and wonder what the hype is, try it out. What the hell.The service was ok, and the ambiance is that of most busy college towns.There are 5 or six chicken finger places in Pittsburgh, PA. im thinking about doing a taste test and yelping all of them.", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "Got Raising Canes for dinner and placed an online order for a short 15 minutes. There was a line all the way down the street and a police officer basically acting like a bouncer at a club. I was expecting my order to not actually be ready in the 15 minutes since I know this just opened but it was ready when I got there. The staff was very nice in the short interaction I had. The place is Pitt themed and really nice inside. Was surprised by how clean it was inside with the chaos happing inside. Now the food... it's raising canes it's amazing. From the chicken to the worlds best toast. Everything was great. My only issue is the one tender was soggy on the bottom but I didn't care. Overall maybe just wait a couple of weeks so it gets less busy. But it's great!", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "I'd like to give this five stars for the food, but: went here for the first time tonight. Chicken and fries are excellent, but the music was turned up so ridiculously loud that I could barely talk to the person next to me. I won't be coming back.", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': 'Big hype for new opening in north versailes pa. Waited for months. Totally disapointed in flavor of chicken.  2.5 stars. Sauce is also a huge disapointment. Mouth full of black pepper and sweet mayo. You must try itvfor yourselves because it is new. Will stick to chicfila and popeyes. Even kfc has bettter chicken if you get it fresh.', 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "Since North Versailles doesn't have one up yet just ate there today freaking fire. That chicken man was it good. That sauce adds the touch and their bread is fire. 10 stars hope they keep it right and not let it go down like every restaurant in the town.", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "The food was excellent we tried the Cane's in Oakland/PITT the customer service was great food came out hot and fast great environment", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': 'I am so pumped that raising canes is finally in Pittsburgh! When we walked in at 1245pm on a Sunday it was packed!!! But the line moved quickly and our food was ready in under 10 mins. Fresh hot and tasty! Plenty of room to sit and crew was cleaning tables as they opened. I left with a belly full of chicken and a smile. :)', 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "Pretty average chicken tenders but probably some of the best fast food fries I've ever had and the texas toast was phenomenal. Staff was nice and the wait really wasn't too long considering it was opening day and they were packed. Will definitely come back in a week or so.", 'review_rating': None}]
