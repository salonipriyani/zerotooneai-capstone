[{'review_text': "This place is amazing. I had the coconut shrimp curry and my partner had the Burmese chicken curry, and they were both so flavorful. My shrimp were perfectly cooked, and had lovely fresh broccoli along side. I'm so glad to see this place open for dinner, and that the quality has remained excellent post-pandemic. They have some cocktails, which looked fun and creative, but I chose tea because their tea selection is top notch.Run, don't walk, to spice island tea house next time you are in Oakland.", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "Have been going here for years. Easily one of the best restaurants in Oakland. Also one of the few opportunities to try Burmese cuisine. For apps ordered Roti and chicken satay. The chicken satay was very good moist yet slight char on outside. Peanut sauce to dip was delicious. The ginger beer was refreshing and the Thai iced tea was a nice touch to the meal. The Java fried rice is always a great option. It is my favorite on the current menu. Perfectly spiced and good portions! The Mohinga soup was a new try of mine but as usual with the restaurant it was just as appetizing as the rest of their offerings. I was unsure about a fish soup, but it was lighter than I expected yet hearty. Feels like something you would have out of someone's home. Warm and inviting.", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "My first visit.  Grabbed a quick bite before an appointment.   Vegetable samosas were good, and the unique dipping suace was a perfect complement.  My daughter had a generous portion of a noodle and shrimp dish that was fantastic.  I wish we were in Oakland more so I could browse my way through the menu.Looks shady from the outside - don't be deceived!  Pleasant staff, quick service and yummy food!", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': 'Super cute place. Great, friendly service, and good food. Loved that you could get a pint of Thai tea (sans cream) to go for $5! Service was fast and they took the time to explain dishes to us and let my daughter try the rose tea beverage before they ordered (which they loved and ordered)!', 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': 'This place is one of our favorites! Even our picky kids say the food is "better than awesome". Great ambiance and great service. Definitely try the slow cooked curry and/or fried rice.', 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "Definitely was fooled by the front of the restaurant. At first when you walk by, it looks shady and the color of a photo is faded from the sun. So you think the place is just a cheap food place...but once you go inside, it's like finding a secret garden. The pad Thai is delicious and they give you a lot! The coconut rice is so good, it's rice made with coconut milk instead of water. Definitely will go there again!", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "Everything I got from this restaurant was absolutely delicious! I got the Pad Thai with chicken and shrimp, vegetable samosas, roti canai, and the semolina cake. The interior of the restaurant is small and quaint but at the moment they are doing just takeout.When I got my Pad Thai, I first thought the portion was a bit small. But, it was actually quite large because of the plate's depth. I really appreciate that they offer both shrimp and chicken with the noodles with no surcharge! The sauce is a little sweet, but that is perfect for me. Only possible issue is that there are not that many nuts, but I don't mind that much.My roti canai was a surprisingly tasty appetizer! The bread is nice and flaky and comes with a delicious, slightly spicy chickpea dip. The roti is a bit more like an Indian paratha, I believe. The vegetable samosas were also amazing. The mashed potatoes were nice and cream, but enveloped in a nice, crispy shell. There were some peas in there, but maybe a little low on the veggies. It came with a spicyish dip which had chilies and a light sweetness too.The semolina cake is very tasty as well. It has a true homemade flavor and it's got a fantastic texture, spongy and a bit creamy. I would say this is one of the best Thai places I have ever been to, even though my experience with Thai food is limited. The owner is also very welcoming! Highly recommend this place.4.65/5", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': 'Just picked up dinner , FABULOUS, hit the spot , always good eating, comfort food at its finest .Basil Fried Rice', 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "Exactly what I was craving! Java fried rice was perfect in every way. Usually I stay away from shrimp but this was so good (not chewy) that I would come back for just the shrimp. It's an unassuming place from the outside but once you step in it's nice and cozy.", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "It's been more than a decade since I lived in Pittsburgh but I still think about this restaurant regularly. Corn fritters, achar, tea salad, noodle soup, char kway teow, all still haunt me. Extremely pleased to see it's still around. Their tea is a life saver when you need something legal to calm you down. Please go and eat good food.", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': 'Very flavorful food, good options for vegetarians, food came out hot.  The restaurant itself is not jazzy - small casual restaurant,  somewhat isolated, modest surroundings,  short operating hours.  But if you go for the food - it is a great place.  Also, servers and owners are very friendly.  Definitely will go back and try some other dishes.', 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "I love this hidden gem in Oakland! Definitely worth a try if you're around. I love the currys here but I wish they had more liquid/sauce to it sometimes.", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': 'If you dine here, you MUST get the Java Fried Rice. It is the most delicious fried rice I have ever had. I tend to gravitate toward vegetable or noodle dishes at Thai places, but this fried rice is an exception. I have returned for it several times.Service is great and the atmosphere is quiet. Spice Island is ideal for a quiet dinner with a small group. They serve fairly large takeout portions as well. Prices are very reasonable compared to other Thai places in Pittsburgh. The Chiang Mai noodles in my opinion were not as good as others I have tried, and the vegetables in garlic sauce were mediocre. The garlic sauce was very good, but the vegetables tasted as though they had been frozen. I do like Spice Islands Pad Thai. I will still be coming back here often, but I do feel like this place is a bit hit or miss. Highly recommend most of the dishes I have tried here.', 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "Very solid and unqiue south asian place in Oakland.There's lots of Thai food in Pittsburgh, but Spice Island separates itself from the others by offering other styles, namely Burmese and Singaporean, and also having a lengthy tea menu!Food here is solid all around, which really impresses me, considering how many cuisines they have to serve. My personal favorite is their Singaporean noodles, because of how savory it is. It's fun to pair curries or a mohinga, for example, which has more mellow flavors, with the Singaporean noodles.The restaurant is also cozy, and very calming honestly for the guests. It's inviting for long conversations and just taking a break here.", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "I work in Oakland and this is a really fun place a little off of the main way for a meal or tea. Any other small towners feeling thankful that Pittsburgh has so much more than Chipotle, Starbucks and other chains? I immediately hoped that with the word spice in the title that their food would be exciting and have a range of flavors. They do not disappoint. Their curries, soups and fried race are very tasty. They do a Thai green curry very well. What I would like to know is why they block out all the natural light. Is this for a cozy vibe? Do they want privacy? I enjoy the aesthetic but I am bummed that they covered up and blocked all the natural light. I plan to to return and try more of their tea blends and Indonesian dishes. So far in the 2 times I've been here I haven't tried anything I didn't love!", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': 'Ummm..... ugh. Such a disappointment.  Either it has gone downhill since college or maybe my palette has changed, but Spice Island SUCKs.  There are so many better places in Pittsburgh to eat.  I will never return.We started with the soup of the day and a salad.  Both were ok, nothing special.My partner ordered the Java rice and I ordered the Panang Curry.  The rice was ok.  The curry was disgusting.  Quite possibly the worst I have ever had.  It was too thick, like old gravy thick and had no flavor.  Literally no spice.  Embarrassingly bad.The service our entire time there was nonexistent.  We had to flag someone down the entire time, had to re-explain simple requests like asking for straws multiple times and waited for our check for 15 awkward minutes.', 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "I have been here twice and the food is very good.  I have had the panaang curry which had a full peanut flavor.. could be overwhelming for some.  The second time i had Spicy Chili Fried Rice with Mixed Seafood... it was good as well.  Lots of seafood and lots of flavors. My daughter loves the java fried rice and has gotten it on both visits.  I will keep coming back. So before I posted this review I was in Oakland and came back. I had the Bermese pork curry with a side of coconut rice. This was from the lunch menu.  I had it with Thai coffee.  My daughters had Java fried rice (of course) with Thai tea and my sister pad Thai. While the bermese curry was very flavorful it wasn't like a typical curry. The pork was very tender and it had potatoes as well.", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "They have a selection of ginger beer cocktails that will knock your socks off! Bangkok Mule, Dark & Stormy, Gin-Gin Mule, Horse's Neck and several others. Drinks are priced at around $8-$9 which is comparable if not slightly less than other places. The food is good. I say this about a lot of places but hey, we live in a city with a lot of good places to eat.I think the menu changes now and again because sometimes I will come back and something I have had previously is no longer available.I do love the hearty noodle dishes. They make a coconut chicken noodle soup that is so satisfying and filling. Burmese chicken curry is full of flavor, juicy and well prepared. Another nice place to bring friends or family for a decent meal.", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': 'My roommate suggested this place and we went on a whim! Ordered take out and it was pretty darn delicious. I got the Panang curry and it was sooooo good. Vegetables were cooked perfectly and the curry sauce was very tasty. I would definitely get this place again!! Highly recommend.', 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': 'One of the better Thai places in Pittsburgh. Food is fresh, yummy, and filling.', 'review_rating': None}]
