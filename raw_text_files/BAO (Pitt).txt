Tad expensive, but worth it. Conveniently all their other food I've tried have also been good.

We settled for the Taiwanese basil chicken, stir fry broccoli, and sui mai. The food arrived quickly. The stir fry broccoli arrived first and then the chicken. - Stir fry broccoli - good leafy like greens cooked in garlic. It's a bit oily but good flavor.- Taiwanese basil chicken - Good flavors, but not much in terms of basil. There are full cloves of garlic and slices of ginger cooked with it to add a robust taste. The chicken is cut up bone-in pieces, so be warned!- Sui mai - six pieces and very plump. It's steamed well. Not as authentic ingredients as traditional siu mai.Service is friendly and fast.

Of course they were right there when it was time to pay.My husband ordered the Japanese beef ramen since the broth was divine the first time but there was absolutely no flavor with this visit. He almost thought he had COVID because of the contrast in flavor. His steamed dumplings were also undercooked and very doughy.I ordered the pork and bamboo steamed buns and they were just okay - definitely could've used more filling.

The space was spacious with plenty of tables in the dining room. Parking was hard with only street parking available but I was determined to make the most of this visit. After settling into the menu I made a bunch of choices and eagerly awaited. Soon my Taiwanese braised pork over rice showed up and it was a nice portion. Pork was minced nicely and braised till very tender with additional pickled vegetables accompanying the dish. Next my Bao and dumplings showed up and both were good, the Bao were juicy as well as the steamed dumplings. I finished my meal with the traditional Chinese egg tarts.

The location is ... a bit hidden, so look closely. Service was excellent and our waiter jumped between english and mandarin and Taiwanese so smoothly.

There were a lot of mochi and a bit of everything else (red beans, grass jelly, tapioca). It's a huge portion, so it's definitely shareable. My friend and I also shared the beef chow fun, and it wasn't very good. The noodles were stuck together and the flavor a bit bland. Overall I was impressed by the variety of food they have.

Their restaurant is clean and aesthetically pleasing, their service is friendly and efficient, and their food is undoubtedly good.I've eaten here multiple times with my family and significant other and never have been disappointed by the quality of their food. Most recently, we had the popcorn chicken, Japanese ramen, Oxtail soup, and the Taro special for dessert. The popcorn chicken is our consistent order every time we go due to its delicious crispiness and savory spices. I was really impressed by their ramen considering it Bao is not a Japanese restaurant. The broth was rich and flavorful, the beef was cut thin which melted in your mouth and the noodles were of a Chinese style but worked perfectly together.The Oxtail was a simple rich soup and it was definitely tasty. I do think it was a little overpriced and could have been more special.I do enjoy going to Bao for nice dates, and proper family meals but wouldn't go on my own if I wanted a quick casual meal.

Located near Pitt, its most definitely a student hangout and probably a welcome comfort for Asian students that doubles as a change of pace for locals.The menu is very eclectic and a bit too ambitious IMHO.  They carry dim sum, noodles, Taiwanese snacks and fare along with bubble tea.  We ordered pretty much a bit of everything and what I can say for sure is stick with the Taiwanese food here.  The popcorn chicken and Taiwanese sausage were spot on.  Cucumber salad was the perfect balance of garlic, sugar and vinegar.  The soup dumplings were also pretty good - soup was rich and clear.  Their Cantonese fare was pretty subpar.  The dim sum was steamed to a mush and their wontons were pretty bad if I'm being honest.  Bubble tea was also surprisingly good although the day we went, the bubbles weren't ready (they said it would take an hour - rookie mistake of not having them cooked an hour or so before opening).  Service was pretty good. Prices are a tad more expensive than what I'm used to for this type of Asian food but given that they might be the only game in town, it's fair.

All the dishes tasted fine, with the exception of the egg custard which tasted as if they used movie popcorn butter for the oil.Also, the timing on the dishes was totally off -- typically you would expect the dim sum to come in first, followed by the entrees. While we would have been ok with getting our orders late (roughly 20 minutes after we got our entrees), the prices that they charged for the dishes and how we did not get a heads up on something that was backordered left us disappointed.While this location does offer convenience for students, I would not recommend going out of your way to make the trek here expecting a pleasant dining experience.', 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': 'Fun college hangout place w some near authentic xlb and other dim sums.

Popcorn chicken: really good! Taste as good as the ones I used to eat growing up in Taiwan! They used real basil to fried the chicken. Salty and flavorful. Pan fried radish cake: savory with real radish inside and crispy outside Japanese ramen with beef shank: this one left something to be desired. The flavor was bland and boring. The beef also tasted old like it's been cooked for a while. Taiwan style mined pork over rice: I didn't try this one but our family very much enjoyed this and the portion was huge Spicy chili fish fillet over rice: my favorite of the whole meal. The fish was fried super crispy and loaded with spice and flavor. I would come back just for this. Japanese style fried pork over rice: another good time on the menu.

I ended up ordering the creme brulee milk tea with boba. I actually really loved the topping. Sometimes with creme brulee toppings, they don't really add anything to the drink and don't taste like anything. This one was creamy and added a nice vanilla pudding-like flavor to the drink. I unfortunately found the milk tea itself to be very mediocre. There were no surprises though; it tasted like milk tea in the form that you'd think of if someone were to say 'milk tea' (but with a little extra something because of the creme brulee topping). The bubbles were almost too hard (which is not a comment easily received from me because I normally love a bubble that 'fights back'), but they WERE... And they tasted really plasticky. As you can see in the photo, it wasn't filled to the top, either, and I think the drink was in the $6 range. For that price (and honestly just in general!), I would have wanted a full cup. I've seen people post positive reviews for their bubble tea though, so I'd be willing to go back and maybe try a fruit drink instead.", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "Decent Taiwanese food. I appreciated the generous portions of meat in the steamed dumpling platter but thought the pork and crab soup dumplings needed more soup.

The pork belly and sauce were so good too. The sauce was a little spicy. Then they brought the pork bao bun which was everyone's favorite. You get 5 of them. They come in the same wrapper as the pork slider. The spice of the meat and the sauce they come with really make it. They were unbelievable. Next, they brought the chicken hibachi rice. We absolutely love hibachi rice. However, this was one of the best any of us have ever had. It was so well seasoned with all the right spices. The chicken was so tender. We finished with the chicken gyoza which is like a Japanese Dumpling. It was good and very similar to a Japanese pirogi. We all felt full afterwards. We were very happy with our server Mitchell. He was amazing from the time we sat down until the time we left. He asked if we had ever been there and when we said no he explained the menu in detail. He and the other staff checked in with us multiple times to make sure we liked everything and had plenty of water. Nothing makes or breaks a restaurant like service.

I can't quite explain it but there is something in this dish that leaves a zing on your palate. I'd try something different next time but it was good. If this was in my neighborhood it'd be on my regular list. This place is absolutely worth your time. Enjoy!", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "The hardest reviews to write are when you have high expectations and they fall far short. We were very hopeful when we saw the menu, which seemed amazing. We ordered wonton soup and various dim sum. Soup was amazing, broth was tasty and wontons were delicious. Next out came our dim sum, and the steamed pork buns ($12) were ice cold, nearly frozen in the middle. We sent it back, and the had the temerity to send out the buns we already bit into. Dim sum needs to be served piping hot, and it is egregious to send the same food out! This was a red flag. Our other dim sum were decently hot, but not steaming as I would expect. Lastly, we ordered crab Rangoon and spare ribs, but we ended up with fried spring rolls. When we bit into the spring rolls, THEY WERE FROZEN INSIDE. WTF BAO??? How can you serve me cold dim sum in January TWICE IN A NIGHT??? Sorry to say, we won't be back.", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': 'Excellent dumplings.

I usually order the dumpling platter, which gives me the chance to try out several of them and makes for a great weeknight dinner option.Last time, I've also had the Korean-style pork belly. My date commented that it was not really very Korean-style, but we both enjoyed the dish---the pork belly was very tender.I've found the desserts to be a bit hit and miss. The piggy cream custard buns are delicious (and cute!), but I did not enjoy the quick-sand buns as much.I should sample a few more of the menu items, as there is a great variety and everything I've seen served at other tables seems delicious.

The pork bao that was fried was very good.  The basil chicken had a great flavor.  All the pieces looked like bone-in thigh type fragments which isn't for everyone.  Overall it was a good lunch.

I've been craving dim sum since the beginning of quarantine, and today was the day to finally revel in nostalgia. Overall, the dishes were exemplary, but the real star of the show was the dipping sauce!!! (an indescribable concoction of salty and spicy goodness)Food:Popcorn Chicken: 8/10 Crispy, light, and salty--these were addicting and were quickly devoured. Came with fried basil as well. Only complaint is that quantity was low, considering their price.Scallion Pancake with Beef: 10/10SO good. Deviates from the traditional preparation, as it comes with bell peppers and peanut sauce (and I wasn't sure if there was hoisin sauce?), but these changes elevated the dish. Our order came with a good amount, enough for some pieces leftover. Hibachi Fried Rice with Beef 15/10 This is the dish I still think about, hours later. There's so much umami flavor packed into the dish, with hefty pieces of beef among bites of veggies balanced with pumps of pepper. Fried rice at hibachi hits different, and I think Bao did a great job in emulating this experience, even when it's served in a plastic bowl for take out.Dumpling Platter: 8/10Comes with 10 dumplings: spinach and shrimp , steamed crystal shrimp, and shu mai. The skin tasted fresh and enveloped a huge portion of meat. A little pricey, but great quality! Pork Belly: 6/10We were really looking forward to this one based on previous reviews. Unfortunately, it did not meet our expectations--I could barely taste the pork belly, which was rather thin, as it was mainly overshadowed by the mound of mustard greens on top. Drinks: Pisces: 7/10My star sign! It was oolong milk tea with grass jelly and taro and whipped cream. Loved the grass jelly. The mashed taro was interesting but I wouldn't crave it. Disappointed at how much smaller my drink was compared to my roommates, despite being a similar price.Mango Sago: 6/10Surprised that this classic dessert was presented as a drink. The mango drink had a lot of coconut flavor but also had a chalky textural aftertaste (which was probably unfamiliar because I usually drink this with a spoon rather than a straw). Leo: 9/10Passionfruit slush with lychee jelly and milk foam. This drink was so refreshing without being cloying. Very classic asian flavor. Miscellaneous: They have pretty cohesive branding. Their logo is cute and their drinks come in sturdy frosted cups with unique shapes and paper straws.

Was excited to try this place as it is located conveniently right on campus in Oakland. There are not a lot of sit down restaurants in Oakland, so it was nice that they have ample seating.

I had the mixed steamed dumplings, which were delicious. The spinach dumpling stuffed with shrimp was my favorite. My friends had the buns, which were good as well. They were stuffed with a hefty amount and pretty flavorful. I also had the Taiwanese chicken, which was super flavorful. The chicken was fresh and crispy. My only complaint would be I was not expecting so many bones. Overall, a great place to grab dim sum in Pittsburgh.
