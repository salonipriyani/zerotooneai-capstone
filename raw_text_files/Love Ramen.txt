[{'review_text': "SO GOOD! GO TO LOVE RAMEN! You won't regret it. Nothing like a build your own ramen spot.", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': 'Very good food, as a college student on a budget the "weigh your meal for the price" system works well. Definitely plan on coming back in the future. Only downside is there is not a sign out front so you just have to watch to make sure you don\'t miss it!', 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': 'Basics to Love Ramen:1) Hard to find since sign really is not visible!  Look for Chinese wording of Fifth Street and inside has a reddish theme.2) Not obvious walking in what they serve.  There is a $/oz sign on the right and what appears to a buffet area of cold items.  Multiple types of noodles, meats, and veggies are available.  3) At the counter there is a scale.  Using the clues given above with no one at the cash stand to give guidance, I can only assume it is a self serve type place where they cook what you choose.  Sure enough, an individual emerges from the back and explains just that and realizes he has to refill the metal bowls up front used to grab the ingredients.  Now it makes sense.I grab a bowl and start to load up with noodles, fried egg, veggies, meats, and the like.  The total came out to about $28 and enough for two people.Overall, the ramen broth has decent flavors, the noodles came out a bit overcooked.  Tip here is to get the minimum amount and do not get too greedy on variety!  3.8888 stars.', 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': 'This is my go-to place after a day of work/school! You could choose from their menu or make your own bowl of noodles which you would pay by weight. If you make your own bowl you\'ll have a choice of soup/broth or you could choose to have no soup. I usually go for the "spicy mala soup" with a medium level of spiciness (the milky pork broth is also a great option if spiciness is a no-go).The make-your-own bowl is maybe a little pricey but it\'s for a reason!', 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "It's a small restaurant. I tried their dry pot dish where I could pick and choose the ingredients and they added their own spice blend and cooked it. Pretty good. The friends I went to the restaurant with ordered noodle soup dishes which were also pretty good.", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': 'Service is poor and is self service like a buffet and paid by the ounce. You have to pick your own ingredients. I have never seen a ramen place do this and I am left with sadness. Never will I come back.', 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': 'Great Chinese street food. You can choose raw food items and pay by weight, and they can make it a spicy and hot wok （麻辣香锅） or spicy and hot soup （麻辣烫）. Both of them are really good!', 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "I go to Pitt and I love this ramen place! It's serve  yourself so you can make it as affordable as you want and can pick the amount of each ingredient. Very authentic!", 'review_rating': None}]
