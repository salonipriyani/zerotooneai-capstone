[{'review_text': 'I had the Fatoosh Salad.  I would have taken a photo, but I ate it too fast!  It was perfect!  Everything tasted like it came straight from the garden.  The homemade dressing is a perfect complement.  I will definitely go there again.', 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': 'The food was delicious & the ambiance made me feel right at home  the workers were very kind as well ... also they give you a lot of extra pita bread!!!', 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "Good food, nice people, tastes authentic. I've stopped in between class many times now and they never disappoint!", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': 'Came here for a quick bite between classes and got a gyro sandwich. A friend had recommended the place to me and I was not disappointed. The woman, who I assume is the owner, was very kind and the food came quickly and was cheap to boot. I could tell from the first bite that the ingredients were fresh. I will be coming back soon!', 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': 'We stopped here for the first time to try this restaurant in Oakland. As we were eating in this tiny place, I heard another diner tell the presumed owner that the diner had had Covid and was hospitalized for 2 weeks and was proudly unvaccinated. The presumed owner, who was unmasked, told the diner that she too was unvaccinated. The discussion continued with both talking about vaccinated people they knew supposedly dying of Covid and others getting very ill from the vaccine.  We told the owner that, because she was unmasked, unvaccinated and spreading misinformation, we would not be back. As we were paying, the owner started arguing, saying that she can have her point of view and we can have ours. She said that we were in no more danger in her business than in any other public place . We told her that we were in more danger in her business because we cannot eat with a mask on! We also told her that our point of view is based on the consensus of the medical community. It is truly disappointing that a business owner can be so misinformed and so careless to her customers.', 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': 'Falafel app, gyro wrap and hummus tabbouleh wrap. Gyro meat is tasty and delicious, hummus tabbouleh wrap also very tasty and fresh. Falafel dry slightly disappointed. Tahini sauce is amazing. Ordered from Grubhub, fast delivery', 'review_rating': None}]
