[{'review_text': "I love this food truck! It's conveniently located across the Soldiers and Sailors parking garage, so I often stop by after parking to grab lunch at least once a week. I typically get the chicken tikka masala and occasionally a samosa, which keeps me full throughout the day. The inexpensive prices for such generous portions also keep me coming back! And without a clay oven, the naan is pretty good.A negative is the sauces easily spill out of their containers, so I just have to be very careful with my transport. And the wait time can get a little long if they're very busy, but you can call and order ahead if needed.Overall, it's a great spot to grab lunch on the go. The owner is very friendly, and I love how there's complementary candies or chips :) I know I'll be back for more chicken tikka masala next week!", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': 'India on Wheels is a food truck that serves Indian foods (e.g., samosa, vegetarian, chicken, lamb, and naan). Based on my one visit, I rate the food as 3 stars and the prices as 5 stars.On a Friday around lunchtime, I was walking around Oakland and looking for a quick place to buy food. I saw this orange truck on the side of the road. Other customers were waiting in line, and I asked them what the approximate wait time was, and they replied about 10 minutes. I ordered a medium-sized chicken biryani for $7 and a medium-sized chicken tikka masala for $7. Months ago, this business raised its prices because of inflation, but these prices are still low.My husband and I ate our food at home. We liked the chicken biryani better. The chicken tikka masala contained chicken that was a color that we have not seen in other chicken. I took one bite of the chicken, and my husband did not eat the chicken at all. I had requested mild sauces, and the sauces were truly mild and had a little spice.', 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "Excited to find out that India on Wheels will be back open at their CMU location during the second week of August! Today, I came here for lunch at the Pitt location on Bigelow and ordered the lunch combo special, which includes 3 curries of your choice, a piece of naan, and a water or a soda. I went with the Chicken Vindaloo, Jeera Chicken, and the Paneer Makhani. All were delicious, except I wish they had given me more chicken in my portions. I also asked for a spice level of 8 but the food wasn't too spicy, so I'm definitely going to ask for a 10 when I go back!", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "I really love the food here!! The wait can sometimes be long depending on the rush, but I'm always happy with my meal. I get the Chicken Tikka Masala, spice 0 (I'm sensitive, okay!), and I love it. I do wish there was a little more chicken though. Overall, great spot for lunch takeout between classes on Pitt's campus!", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "Was super excited to try this and was happily surprised but the portions, but a bit disappointed by the flavor. The lamb biryani and chicken tikka masala were basically overflowing from their containers, so it's definitely a bang for your buck. However, the chicken tikka masala could've been more flavorful and the rice was disappointingly not basmati :-( The garlic naan could have also had a stronger garlic flavor. Maybe we came in with too high of expectations from the raving reviews we've heard, but it wasn't as great as we were hoping it to be.", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': 'If you know me you know I\'ve been to a lot of restaurants and food trucks. So when I say this is the best Curry I\'ve had in North America, and the best food truck I\'ve ever eaten from, you know I\'m either on acid, or dead right. Or more likely, both.When I see this food truck, I start doing "India on Cartwheels" in my mind. And I let out a few "India on Squeals." I brought my friend Remington here, thinking it was "India On Steele\'s." And if it were referring to my guy friend from Hyderabad who is currently dating my girl friend from Cardiff, it\'d be "India on Wales." Ahem.What to get: Large Chicken Tikka Masala (spice level 1-10) for $5.50.Why: It\'s the best curry in North America, and I\'ve had at least 57% of them.You\'re lying: Yes, I\'m horizontal in bed right now because I\'m full to the brim of IoW curry.So they how are you going to get to the gym today: You\'re going to have to curry me out.Seriously, if you only eat 1 thing in Pittsburgh, let it be this. They open from around 11 to 6 each day (shorter hours when school is out, sometimes), parked on Bigelow about 2 blocks north of the Cathedral Of Learning. There\'s a new one over by Carnegie Mellon too, haven\'t been yet.I\'ve sent and taken many people here now, and the *majority* think it is one of the best curries they\'ve ever had. Including people who have lived in and visited England and/or India. So I\'m not crazy. I get requests to drive it all the way back to Buffalo most times I\'m here.The prices are ridiculously low. It\'s silly. I mean, they\'re basically giving these amazing curries away. The Samosa Chaat is good, the Mango Lassi not so good, but it\'s the curries that win the world universe galaxy curry contest. Chicken Tikka Masala is *the* one. It tastes a lot like the curries over in England (British Indian is a cuisine all unto itself, invented by Indian immigrants, and perhaps the most delicious genre of food you can get in the UK... and we all do). It would actually be one of the best ones in London, Birmingham, Manchester, or even Bradford. Except that it\'s in Pittsburgh.Don\'t leave it out of the fridge for too long, or it\'ll be "India on Congeals." And be grateful it\'s served over rice and not "India on Oatmeal." If you eat so much of it that you get super tall, I\'ll call you "India on Shaquille." And if you want to turn me on while eating it, try "India on High Heels."The people of Pitt just don\'t know how lucky they are to have this truck here. I drive 4 hours from Buffalo just to have it, on a bi-monthly basis. Not that I\'m bi, but I would be, if that was the only way to scarf down this curry regularly.However, one caveat is that not everyone will like it. If you\'re used to "Indian Indian" over British Indian, or if you are used to the Americanized crap (sorry), then this might not be your cup of tea. It\'s a matter of taste. If it\'s not your cup of tea, we can\'t be friends anymore. (Joke) (Sort of). Some of the negative reviews here are actually clearly from people who were expecting Americanized crap, and "don\'t get it." It\'s their loss, really.Another caveat, and my only complaint, is that while they\'re lovely people, in some of their online responses... I\'d advise them to be a little more "kissy-assy", one might say. I sent a friend here, and her experience was not great. I wish the responses to her review had been more gentle, less confrontational. An argumentative response to a negative review is so much more off-putting to potential customers than the review itself. If they ever remove those responses and start being suck-ups ;) then I\'ll remove this paragraph. I just want them to be loved by all the way I love them, for the *incredible* food.Service: amazing. The owner is a wonderful guy, and has even stayed open late for me on several occasions, I\'d call from Ohip and tell him I\'d be 20 mins later than closing. No problem. Wow!If you get it on a Sunday, it\'s "India on Steelers." And if your banana just un-peeled itself, then "India on Repeel." With these prices, it\'s more like "India on Great Deals." Or "India on Steals." I might make a movie about this truck: "India on Reels." Or it might turn me into one of those shirtless studly Bollywood guys, so my nickname could be "India on Sex Appeals."And if you eat more than 1 thing in Pitt, you may also want to try the Rib Eye Taco at Las Palmas (on Brookline), and the Gyro from Greek Gourmet or Gali\'s, as well as the steak sandwich at Gaucho, and the Old Bay - Wet wings at Bob\'s Big Shot. But if it\'s just 1 thing... let it be this Chicken Tikka Masala. Believe it.Anyway I\'ve been rambling too long, I feel like I\'ve given you the whole "India on Spiel."And if it were referring to how most Indians imagine themselves hooking up with Jessica Biel (or any one of her sisters), then it\'d be "India on Biels."Whereas if it were about how emotional I get when I eat this spectacular, incomparable Chicken Tikka Masala, it\'d be named "India on All-The-Feels."', 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "*HIGHLY RECOMMENDED**4.5/5*For cheap, fast, and good Indian food, this is the place. Located right on campus, India on Wheels is one of my favorite places to get Indian food. They have very good portioned meals for only $4/$5 depending on the size you get; I can get two meals out of one large order. I've tried so many of their food and all of them are real tasty. This food truck has save me many times when I was starving on campus and couldn't afford to spend that much on food. Best part is that you can substitute rice with naan, and their naan is amazing. Some of my favorite items include chicken saag, tikka masala, and korma. But honestly, all of their curries are great.*VERDICT*Would always go back 100%. It's crave-worthy :)", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "This place is SO good and SO cheap. It's $7 for a large platter including a soda and the portions are huge. I've gotten the chicken tikka masala and vindaloo multiple times and they're on point! I've got a pretty high spice tolerance, and usually will order the highest spice rating with the expectation that it won't be as spicy as I want it. The spice rating is out of 10 and they take a 10/10 spice seriously!! But the flavors are so good here and the price just is the cherry on top. You can call in your order and they take payment with Zelle. The owner is super nice and I've called to place an order 5 min before closing and they were so accommodating. I just moved to Pittsburgh and am so glad I found them because they're definitely on the lunch/dinner rotation!", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': 'I really enjoyed my food here and was able to have rice instead of the included naan!

Honestly much better than any of the dishes I had  at Prince of India near by, and for $5.50 you get a large portion, actually had plenty of shrimp and spicy enough.(I asked for 9/10 so probably for 9 I did want it to be spicier)The place has enough options, including vegetarian and shrimp options.If I had to complain, the rice looked a little weird, and I don't really like the curry served all over the rice, but again for a food truck its understandable. Also it did take time.Overall I will definitely go there again, and pretty regularly at that too.", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "This food truck keeps me going at CMU.

I thought 10 min. would be sufficient, but the guy on the phone told me it would take 20.  So, I gave them 15 min. before heading down to pick up my order.Based on others' recommendations, I ordered a small chicken tikka masala.  Given that the curry I'd ordered from the truck next door had been unbearably spicy for my taste at my normal spice level of 4, I decided to play it safe and order my dish with a spice level of 3.  I also ordered a mango lassi to accompany it, which I typically order with Indian dishes.  Both items cost $6 together, which is a bargain, even in Oakland.Both the presentation and quality of the food at this truck were comparable to that of the truck next door.  The dish consisted mostly of rice and curry, with a few large chunks of chicken on top.  The chicken varied in quality, with some chunks consisting of questionable quality dark meat, and one chunk consisting of white meat.  The curry had a decent flavor and consistency, but was rather bland in terms of heat, which was a surprise after receiving super-spicy curry from the truck next door.  As for the mango lassi, it was similar to the one I received from the truck next door in its thin and rather watery consistency.Although the food from this truck isn't something I'd go out of my way for, it's a convenient lunchtime option, esp. for college students and people who work at Pitt or Presby Hospital.  In addition to taking phone orders, this truck is on Tapingo.  Regardless of how you order, just be sure to allow enough time for them to make it, given that the food is MTO.", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "I've been meaning to try this food truck for awhile, and when I finally did, it didn't disappoint! I ordered a small portion of their paneer curry with rotis and at $5 for a generous and delicious portion, it hit all the right spots for me! Steaming paneer in warm curry and fresh warm chapathis.. what more can one want! They have some combo offers for larger appetites and you can pick from roti, naan and rice to go with your curries.

According to my senior colleague (who has been at Pitt for over 20 years), this is the best food truck at University of Pittsburgh.  The food is certainly very good and inexpensive.  It's highly recommended for a quick eat near campus.  The portions are large, and you will likely have some food left over.  You can also specify spiciness.  The biryani (chicken, vegetable, shrimp, or lamb) is $4.00 for small and $5.00 for large.  I usually get the chicken biryani, which is cooked with basmati rice, coconut sauce, nuts, and herbs.

I always had leftovers, something a broke college student can appreciate.I pretty much stuck with the lamb vindaloo or chicken tikka masala all three summers I attended classes in the area. They served it up with basmati rice and I\'d order a mango lassi when it was available.Services was fast and efficient, so that was a plus when we only had limited time between morning and afternoon sessions.

I promise you won't regret it!!", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "i love india on wheels! i'm a vegetarian and there are always tons of options. i've pretty much made my way through the veggie options at this point. food is always delicious (personal favs are the saag chole and chana masala) and the man who cooks is a delight. huge portion for a great price. i always get my food at a spice level 7 - i have moderate tolerance for spice - and it's perfect and consistent. (for people that order a 1-3 and say no flavor, what did you expect??)only downside is that the meals are often more rice than whatever i ordered. i asked for less rice once and they did oblige. as another reviewer noted, they are perpetually out of shrimp - i'm not sure why it's even on the menu at this point.around lunchtime, they can get SUPER busy - as in, once i waited 30 min for my food. huge line. but there's just one guy in there cooking, so it's understandable. also, CASH ONLY!", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "Everything I've tried are wonderful. I love chicken curry the most! If only they have had more variety to choose from, this would be my first choice for lunch.", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': 'This is pretty standard Indian food.  Rita aunty is a sweetheart, and creates a truly affordable and decent meal.  It was definitely food that helped me when I missed home, and when I was low on cash during my college years.  If you are in the mood for a cheap & quick Indian meal check this place out.', 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "Another great truck right on Bigelow in Oakland. I've stopped here for food at least a couple of times and have generally been happy with the quality of the food. Of course, these trucks typically cater to the college students that enjoy large portions of food for a cheap price, and generally care a little less about quality.  However, there are no complaints about the curry here- and being a graduate student myself, I'm not as picky when I'm getting food on the go and out of a truck and paying $5 for it.  I'll continue to stop by here for lunch. As with all of the trucks, plug their number in and call ahead so you can pick your food up as soon as you get there.", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': 'Best biryani ever.  Anywhere...anywhere.  The chicken is so tender that it falls apart.  Of all the places in the area, only this place cooks the rice the way I like it too.

I got the chicken tikka masala and didn't realize how large it was going to be. Good Indian food for a good price. The people working are very nice, always a plus!

Everything is made fresh, the portions are huge, and it's an amazing value for just $5! I recommend this place to everyone who visits Pitt.

I'm not brimming with money. But Good heavens, 30minutes for a Butter chicken. I was wondering if they were plucking the feathers off the chicken before they cooked it. SUPER SLOW! The food is , meh. I can totally do with out. Was hungry, thought they were good. But I'm starting to become convinced, Pitt students (majority) maybe use to bad food. Unless you have a month to wait, go to this place. Oh, and their food isn't fresh, it's frozen and then reheated,.
