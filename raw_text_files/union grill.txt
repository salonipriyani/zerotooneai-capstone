Clean and service was nice and steady.', 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': 'I have to give an update here, although it\'s a little over due. Things have changed. The food? Still great. Everything else? Not so much. They remodeled awhile back - not uncommon for them. The interior has been through a few iterations over the last decade or so. But this time it was drastic. The formerly warm, cozy atmosphere has been completely replaced with a cold, cheesy diner motif. It\'s just a very bright, uncomfortable space now. It looks like something Restaurant Impossible would come up with. Also, and I haven\'t been there in several months, but the last time we were there, they must have upgraded the HVAC because the vents were blowing like a CAT 3 hurricane. Our hair was blowing in the wind at our table and we were all freezing. Our girls had their winter coats on with the hoods up for the whole meal. We asked what was up with the AC, and the server just said "oh yeah it turns on every few minutes" and walked away. It\'s a huge bummer.', 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "This restaurant has great food and affordable wine. I usually get a salmon salad. The salmon quality has always been excellent. The remodeling is also very nice. They serve food until 10 pm too, it's hard to find places with quality food who serve past 8 or 9pm. Service has always been great, there are a couple of people who have been working here for many years. That's usually a good sign of good ownership and management in my opinion. The only reason why I can't give this 5 stars is the music :/ It's constant clear channel pop, not a good background for sitting down for a delicious meal.", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "One of my new favorite places in Oakland! I know that it's been around for a while, but it's been recently renovated and it's awesome! I've been here for lunch and dinner now, and both times have been a hit. The pierogis as a appetizer were very flavorful and cooked well. The brownie sundae for dessert (only $2 btw!) is standout. Comes out warm with the perfect amount of ice cream and whipped cream on top. Perfect to share after a big meal. The best part about this place is the main meals. I was nervous about trying the UG fish taco, but it was SO GOOD. Huge portions for only $15. A little messy to eat, but we'll worth the hassle. In this meal I also had the angry mule, and it was delicious! Def check this place out for happy hour on Friday and Saturday nights from 8-10pm (all drinks on the menu are half off).

Now let me get to that!!!Salads: you can't beat them! Tons of fresh veggies all chopped up, your choice of protein which are are beautifully cooked, awesome dressing, you can't go wrong!!Did you say fish tacos? What about one ginormous one?? You can find that here! Although I ate it too fast to take a pic, this was amazing- a big beer  battered piece of white fish in a tortilla stuffed with everything you want in a fish taco.

I really liked the atmosphere and energy of the servers. I enjoyed my greek salad and the pierogies a ton. My fish taco was good as well, nice flavors... only downside to my experience was that there was SO much food. Since we both ordered cod, we got overwhelmed and the batter made us feel so full. I don't think we will both get cod next time. I would just share one dish instead since the portions are big! We definitely got our money's worth with the amount of cod in there but it just felt so heavy at the same time.", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': 'I wanted to check this place out and it definitely does live up to its hype.

I happened to like the cozy old look but it's cool they are evolving some things but keeping what was good (the food!).  Such a solid and reliable Pittsburgh establishment.  For me it's the salads.  They are perhaps the best the city has to offer.   The dressings are all homemade and delicious.   I usually pass on boneless chicken breasts but theirs are always plump and juicy.

We got here around 3 pm and waited about an hour for a table as a party of 9, which is fine and understandable... however, please give some sort of indication. We were told our table was just waiting for the patrons to leave. The patrons had their food boxed and ready to go, and they waited for the bill for quite some time. Once it came, nobody ever came to get it. Another large table became free, and we asked if we could have that one instead. Only then did they clear out the other table's patrons.  I would say their process was about 30 minutes to pay. My parents and husband went to the bar to wait and have a drink. Two of the beers came out in warm mugs, and my mom's beer was forgotten. At least her mug was frosty by the time we flagged someone down! All in all, the food was pretty good. Everything was enjoyed except for the chicken fingers. My dad got the French onion burger. I think this will be my choice if we should return. The reuben was very tasty, and the ratios were very good, although my 11 year old co-diner said it would be WAY too much meat for her (haha). My husband's umami burger was full of...umami. Our friend got the fish sandwich, which was massive. Although it looked light, he said it was way too heavy and that the breading seemed to have soaked up way too much of the grease.

I love the fish tacos and the salmon here. Their fish taco used to be a huge piece of cod in one taco but recently they just switched over to three individual tacos. It makes me sad but they know how to make tacos and it's still yummy. They used to serve amazing waffle fries but they had a supply issue and it's now regular fries, but it's still amazing.

Unfortunately, I just started photographing and reviewing food in 2018 so a lot of great restaurants and meals were missed. One of these is Union Grill. I lived in Oakland for seven years while a dental student and resident, and I ate at Union Grill regularly. Why? The answer is simple. The Classic UG Fish Taco is one of my favorite restaurant meals ever. It is the GOAT fish taco.  You just cannot beat the combination of large size and amazing flavor for the price.The beer-battered cod filet--the "Union Fish"-- is always perfectly cooked. The homemade guacamole, crunchy red cabbage, grated cheddar, fire-roasted corn salsa, SPICY Sriracha sauce, and COOL lemon cilantro sauce all complement each other and the "Union Fish" perfectly to give this taco incredible flavor. I have never left even one crumb on my plate lest I miss out on another chance to savor the flavor.My mother also generously gave me part of her Salmon (Chargrilled) UG Fish Taco.

The pot roast comes with mashed red potatoes, which were good, and the vegetable of the day which was broccoli. The broccoli was a total miss. It was over cooked and didn't go well with a dish that was begging for carrots. The pot roast nevertheless was very good. The red wine and tomato added to the beef stock made it distinctive and delicious.  You get a large portion, much more than you should probably eat.

They were topped with melted shredded cheese and served with sour cream, but they were slightly on the greasy side.The chicken tenders with waffle fries and homemade honey mustard dressing were perfectly on point.  We all loved the honey mustard so much we ordered more and also another order of fries just so we could dip!Everyone wanted a bite of the turkey Devonshire.  It was rich, creamy and super-filling topped with bacon slices and that cheese sauce bubbling straight out of the oven with a charred surface to it.  Yum, yum, yum!I thought we were done, then our younger daughter decides she wanted a dessert...and who could resist a $2 brownie sundae?  The mini brownie sundae was cute, with a brownie that was slightly underdone (loved it) and served warm with vanilla ice cream.From there, we simply crawled back to our daughter's dorm in our food-induced coma.

They have a bunch of beer/wine options, but I opted for their seafood instead. Decent portion size for the price, tasted pretty fresh and was a filling meal. Their side options also include waffle fries vs regular fries, and those were fried to just the perfect crispy texture.

Your grandparents should be able to hear you while they visit you in Pittsburgh. I'm really sticking with this as a parent's weekend restaurant for students. It's just what it is.I am highly satisfied with the Pittsburgh centric options on the menu. Other than that, most of the options are simple burgers, meats, and seafood options. I want to focus on the latter. I ordered the fish tacos, or fish taco. Well, it's really more of an open face burrito. The fish was delicious and the slaws and sauces, but the guacamole tasted old and was turning grey.

I was informed that they could no longer get the turkey that lived up to their standards, but they still make it with chicken instead. It was good, and since I would be in town for awhile, thought I'd go again sometime. Well, I went again tonight and noticed they had happy hour from 8-10p. It was almost 8p and the server informed me that it really starts at 7:45p anyway. I ordered a beer and it was meh! Not very cold and closer to room temperature. I drank it anyway, since what the heck, 1/2 off. I ordered a burger and fries, which were good and then ordered a second beer. Well when the bill came, I was charged full price for the 1st beer, and 1/2 off for the second. So I asked the server and she stated there was nothing she could do, so I asked for the Manager. Well Manger Nichole storms over and with much attitude and no customer server skills, says there is also nothing she could do as it's in the system that way. I tried to explain what the server told me and also tried to show her a text I sent when I sat down that indicated the time was happy hour time. She did want any part of it and basically didn't want to do anything until I persisted. She snatched up my receipt and stormed off stating she wasn't going to argue over $2.50, again with much attitude and eye rolls, and went to the computer system to fix the bill. She didn't need to give me attitude as I could have complained about warm beer and refused to pay for any of it. She could have simply stated she was sorry for the inconvenience and just took care of the situation. Not sure, but she seemed to have anger issues, and the owner or upper management needs to have a talk to her about this. It makes me feel as a patron not to visit this establishment again, or tell my friends and colleagues about the Union Grill, where the beer is warm and the manager has an attitude....", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': 'Fast service, amazing food, and great atmosphere!

Our server brought us huge glasses of water. It took about 10-15 minutes before our food came out.Wow! The portions are HUGE. And the burgers were very satisfying. The beef burger was very juicy and the cod was practically falling apart with every bite. It was soft and the breading was crispy and flaky. Adding tartar sauce was a good choice! I couldn't finish my meal so I took half the cod burger to go. However I got a baked sweet potato as a side and I finished that at the table. It was served with a delectable cinnamon sugar butter. The waffle fries to my surprise were not the highlight of my meal. They were okay, not living up to the hype. But the burgers?

The wait is very typical for weekend nights but it's pretty quick to get seated (maybe not the same for large groups).

I've never tried the burgers but the salads are great too. Their portions are huge like many have said. For the fish taco, the price point between the cod fish and the salmon may deter ppl from ordering the salmon but it's so much better than the cod!! The cod doesn't really taste like much and it's more like all the different sauces and stuff on the taco that makes it good but the salmon is even better because it tastes good even without all the sauces and such. I usually get the salmon dinner and it's so good! The sides (I get coleslaw and fries) are also v tasty. I like that this place serves a lot of different groups.

The outside tables were taken which was fine but indoors there were only two other patrons. We were greeted right away by the hostess who seated us however we were never really acknowledge. After waiting about 20 minutes no one stopped to say they would be right with us or to take an order. There were two waitresses and the hostess chatting at the for about 10 feet from where we were seated. Again no acknowledgement. I noticed a waitress outside serving those customers and thought well perhaps they were having trouble getting help. After another 15 minutes I've not being acknowledged my husband and I decided to leave. As we were doing so the waitress who was chatting at the bar ran over and said I'm sorry I was just coming to get your order is there something I can get for you at that point we had had enough. If you go to this place you may wait more than your fair share of time. Hopefully this is stablish mint can become more customer-friendly to attract patrons back into the restaurant.
