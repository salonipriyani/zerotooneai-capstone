[{'review_text': 'If you are close to cmu and want pizza this is the spot! Sometimes you might be craving pizza and fries at the same time! Welp you can both!! Their service is quick! The only thing to keep in mind is that for larger groups it might be an issue as the seating is limited. :)', 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "I've already written at length about how good the food is here, so I won't double back and repeat everything even though it's all still true. Today I just want to talk about how great the staff is at Ege. I live near the restaurant, but still opted to Uber Eats my delivery the other night because I had a good coupon. When my two pizza order arrived, I was dismayed to find that only one had been delivered. So I just walked over to the restaurant to see if the driver had forgotten one. He hadn't-- the staff was confused because they'd just sent him out the door with two pizzas a few minutes before. Even so, the folks at Ege put together the rest of my order in just a couple minutes.Great business. Great people. Delicious food. Much appreciated.", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "I ordered via postmates pizza was burnt. Cheese was congealed, overcooked, and rubbery. I've eaten here before and liked it. I'm not sure what happened, but I don't think I'll be back.", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "EGE has good fast casual Mediterranean that's made to order and quick. The food had more of an Americanized Mediterranean concept (I.e fries on the falafel, unique pizza flavors,etc) but was still good. I got the specialty Barcelona pizza which came with spicy chipotle sauce, chicken, and creamy ranch. I want to try the other pizzas next time, they have such fun combos!", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "Delicious Mediterranean food, and undoubtedly high quality food products. There are not very many places in Pittsburgh that let you order a build your own Mediterranean bowl. It's a bit like Chipotle for Mediterranean food, but local, higher quality, and also has options for pizza, sweets, salad, and so on. I ordered the build your own bowl with sun dried tomato, raisins, chickpeas, vegan ranch, tangy minty yogurt, roasted seasonal vegetables, feta, rice, and chicken shawarma. I also tried the kadayif dessert.This place is a tad on the more expensive side, but I think it's worth it. The ingredients are very flavorful and the portions are decent. The shawarma was flavorful and pretty good texture. Solid. I really enjoyed the sun dried tomato, which was perfectly sweet. However, I didn't realize the yogurt has thin strips of cucumber in it, so it was not my favorite.Rice was well cooked but pretty standard. They add a fair amount of feta cheese to it for no extra up charge, which was very well appreciated. I assume the roasted seasonal vegetables change depending on the time of year, but I received squash, zucchini, and carrots I believe. The vegan ranch was very good! Not sure if it's homemade, but it's nice to have this vegan option available here. Decent amount of raisins. They are generally great for vegans, as you can even get vegan pizza options.Honestly, one of my favor parts of the meal was 100% a surprise: the pita. Usually, pita is a side thought, but not here. This is definitely the best pita I have had in a very long time, maybe ever. It's thick and seems homemade. Fluffy and delicious. I would order extra pita for next time.I believe this is one of the only if not the only place in Pittsburgh currently serving kadayif. They rotate between baklava and kadayif. Both are homemade. They used an adequate amount of sweet syrup which was delicious. The texture is a bit weird (it's like crunchy noodles with walnuts in a sweet syrup) but I definitely liked it.All in all, this is a very good place to visit if you want Mediterranean food. The meat is decently good, there is variety, and very high quality ingredients. I would say the sun dried tomato is a must, and the pita was delicious. Get your fresh Mediterranean food craving satisfied here!", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "The falafel sandwich was giant and stuffed to the brim with fries. Not what I'm used to but was decent. Service was good and quick. Good drunk food and I'm sure the students love it, but not for the finer pallet.", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "I have been vegan for approximately a year now.  I do not care much for desserts or sweets, which tend to be the common vegan replacements that taste authentic.  Dairy products were my favorite thing, and there are very few dairy alternatives that taste like the real thing, or even decent to begin with.  I have now ordered over five pizzas from here, and I am so grateful to have found this place.  Their pizzas are not just the only good ones I have had, but they taste very similar to real dairy.  I used to order a chicken and spinach pizza with a white sauce from domino's, which I missed a lot, but I ordered theirs and it satisfies the cravings.  I have also ordered their vegan ranchero and find it to be incredible.  I recommend EGE Mediterranean to those who miss dairy products, as this is the only place I have found with something that genuinely tastes like cheese.", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "I'm currently on a vegan/gluten-free diet and my sister is already vegan so we decided to try to find somewhere we had never been in Pittsburgh but could both eat there. And let me tell you - diet or not - WE ARE GOING BACK. Like are you kidding me!!?!? How did they make everything taste so good yet still have a cultural feel to it!?!! First of all, we both are not fans of vegan cheese, but I truly believe that Vegan Ranchero tasted amazing because of all of the flavors around the cheese that supported it. It was so good!! Spoiler alert - it's actually even better as leftovers the second day... buy extra lol. But then of course we needed to buy something green and the pesto bread salad (got it on gluten free bread) was so good!!! The crust was a perfect light vehicle to pop the arugula and veggies in your mouth. Not pictured is the falafel and rice we also got and the yogurt sauces (not vegan) on the side were amazing - broke the diet for that one. The people were so kind and I reallllllyyyy wish they had a huge place where you could dine in and chat. It's a great meal. We'll be back to try more **chef's kiss**", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "This is a take out only spot Or delivery.We decided to just walk in and orderIt's a tiny place no place to sit downYou order at their counter You can watch them prepare your tasty mealWe had falafel it was delish served in warm fresh with fries pickles and hummus in there Just like in the Middle East We also had a delish chicken bowl with rice and salad so good They have salads Bowls Generous portions Reasonable prices We will be back", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': 'Excellent pizza. The dough is very fluffy and the small is the perfect serving size. I loved the vegan one. Really nice they offer halal meat.', 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "Great pizza! Tried this place on the recommendation of some family and we were very pleased. We got two pizzas to go: Butcher's Choice and Spanikofeta. Both were delicious but very different, so they went well as a pair. Butcher's Choice was a heavy, salty, heaping mound of all the pork you could think of on red sauce (pepperoni, sausage, ham, bacon). Spanikofeta was much more subtle, with spinach, feta, herbs, and a buttery/smooth flavor. Very unique! Both had pretty thin and chewy crust.The menu is huge so we will definitely go back soon to try some other pizzas.", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "WOW!! I was visiting Pittsburgh for the weekend as a huge Mediterranean fan I had to pick up some falafel and baklava and OMG I was so impressed!!We got a BYO bowl, one of the pizzas, and the vegan baklava!! The BYO bowl was awesome I loved how many choices they were and everything tasted like high quality ingredients. My friend LOVED the Genovese pizza and said she wants to come back for it! The vegan baklava was by far the favorite thing we got!! I had never had vegan baklava before so I wasn't sure what to expect. I assumed it was going to be with maple syrup instead of honey so I was skeptical to see how that would affect the flavor, but they managed to create a DELICIOUS vegan syrup that really tasted like honey and preserved the traditional flavors of baklava!! 5/5 I would recommend Ege to everyone who visits!", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "They are closed as far as I can tell. The phone doesn't work and I think it's closed due to health regulations but I don't know for sure.", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': 'First time trying EGE and was very impressed! The food is a bit on the expensive side (starts at $13.99 for the 12 inch specialty pizzas), but you can tell that the ingredients are good quality and the pizza is very well made. The shrimp was very plump and juicy, and there was a lot of shrimp and crab meat on the pizza. We ordered online and the food was ready in ~15 minutes. Would definitely recommend!', 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "What amazing food! Just tried for for the first time today - had the chicken shawarma. Was fresh and packed w great flavor. Will make this a regular stop when I'm in Pitt. Highly recommend.", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "The Casablanca pizza is amazing.  Hot and sweet, maybe the perfect pizza.  Really pleased with the gyros as well.  We still have more items on the menu to try, but it's quite a find.", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': 'My friend ordered their Ranchero Pizza (16 inch) and It was delicious! There were a lot of fresh toppings and the bread was crispy well seasoned. The pizza definitely exceeded our expectation- the combination of bell peppers, ranch dressing, tomatoes and crispy fries were perfect. The takeout order took around 15-20min, but we also went at peak hours. Would love to try their other menu items!!Update: I got their Ege pie with kale and egg (along with tomatoes, jalapeno, onions and parsley that you can add on for free) and it was BOMB. Ive never had a pizza with such generous toppings (there was so much kale :) ) and so unique. 10/10 recommend', 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': 'I ordered the 12" Mangol Soujcul Mediterranean Pizza. It was made fresh in front of me, and the time and attention put in to making sure it was perfect was so kind. The owner, an older man, was kind and patient which made the experience that much better. The crust is light, crispy on the outside and fluffy and warm on the inside. The sauce is perfect with the toppings. Everything tasted fresh, warm and homemade. I added some red pepper flakes for spice.Highly recommended 10/10', 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': 'highly recommend! everything was super fresh & flavorful!  authentic mediterranean style foods', 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "Just walked in off the street because we heard it was good. It's just a place you walk up and order and take to go. We got the pizza blanco, which was kind of like a white pizza. It was really good but in my opinion had had too much garlic, think a whole roasted clove as a topping. I would go back and probably order a different type of pizza.  But they were quick and friendly!", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': 'Pizza did not come with toppings ordered and were extremely cheesy and greasy; poor value for the price.  Bowl was also very underwhelming considering the $15 price tag. Would not order from there again.', 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "A must try. This takeout/delivery place opened a couple weeks ago and I will definitely be returning. It is a small place on N. Craig St., right across from the Sunoco, with a friendly and welcoming staff.They offer a variety of Mediterranean dips, wraps, bowls and unique twists on pizza. The best part is, if you don't want one of their existing offerings, you can build your own! We opted for:EGE favorite pizza - hot with fresh toppings, crispy crust, and chicken skewers on top. YES, MEAT STICKS ON PIZZA. You also get the option to finish your pizza with additional olive oil, parm, seasonings, etc. very nice touchBYO Bowl - great option if you want alittle big of everything: 1. Pick base: greens, grains, etc. 2. Protein. 3. Choice of toppings (included): beets, grilled veggies, chickpeas, fried jalapeños, etc. 4. Dips: baba, hummus, red pepper, etc. 5. Cheese. 6. Dressing. Can be alittle overwhelming with all of the options, but if you're like me and you need to try all the things, this is the way to go. For about $11, the sizable portion was well worth the price and they did not skimp on the gyro meat. It took about 30 minutes from time of order and because I ordered online, they were having a promo where we got a FREE small pizza with garlic sauce, arugula, and Parmesan! Can't beat that.", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "LOVE this place!! Just got it tonight for the second time and somehow it was even better?? I made my own bowl with rice, spinach, shrimp (which was literally amazing), hummus, chickpeas, artichokes, olives, and the minty yogurt sauce. The bowls come with pita that is definitely baked fresh AMAZING!!! My boyfriend got the red pepper dip on his and it was so good so I'll definitely be getting that next time. The people who work there are very nice and they had my order right away when I got there. I ordered online off their website and I actually got a free pizza as well!", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': 'This has very quickly become one of my favorite takeout spots during lockdown!  Easy pickup or delivery through any of the many ordering apps.  Classic Mediterranean dishes and pizzas are all awesome, a rarity for a place doing double duty.  Veggie and vegan options are incredible, with this place offering both the hits - hummus, falafel, tabbouleh - and some unique finds like veggie meatballs and chicken.I was compelled to write this review after trying the vegan buffalo chicken pizza for the first time - I am a longtime vegan constantly chasing the high of "real" buffalo chicken pizza and this may be one of my favorites I\'ve tried.  Fries on a pizza already piled high with sauce and roasted red pepper and vegan chicken may sound like overkill.  Just let it happen.  My only critique is that I wish the buffalo fries were also a separate menu item because they are divine.

One pizza 4 cut with 4 chicken kebabs on it was outstanding . All meat pizza was super, plain was great as well. All tasty and filling .

Everything ive had from them was delicious. Portions are large. There pizzas are killer. Try the casablanca if you're adventurous.

Definitely recommend ordering takeaway/pickup, as there is not much seating. The pizza is fresh and the make-your-own options are delicious.

Best falafel and homemade pita I\'ve had in a long time. Fill with plenty of options. Plenty of Tahini sauce and was mouth wateringly good.

The pita was warm, chewy, and soft. It made the perfect pocket for the delicious fillings. They LOADED it up with tons of sliced gyro meat, gorgeous tomato, crunchy lettuce, tangy and zesty tzatziki, and even crispy FRIES! I got two meals out of it-- it was huge and very tasty. My sister got one of the bowls. It was super spicy, but just the way we like it. The red pepper spread was awesome. The best part of EGE?
