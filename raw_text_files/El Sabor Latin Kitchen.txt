[{'review_text': "I have driven past El Sabor an embarrassing amount of times and had never tried it. Recently I wanted to order delivery and saw they were an option so I finally did it! I always go into ordering  delivered food with a grain of salt because it's not coming straight from the kitchen. Let me tell you, El Sabor absolutely amazed me. I got the grilled chicken Baja burrito just the way it comes. I'm so mad I didn't take a photo but it was too good to stop indulging. I can't even believe a delivered burrito was that good - the temperature, quality, flavor. We also got the queso & chips and of course, was awesome. I cannot wait to go back & try it in person, especially with a margarita in hand!", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': 'So, my partner in crime and I found ourselves riding the taco wave at the illustrious Taco Fest this weekend. Among the merry food trucks, there stood El Sabor Latin Kitchen, surrounded by a line so long it could\'ve been mistaken for a Latin sentence - and I\'m not just throwing around Latin flair, amigo.Imagine this: folks waiting and burning up in the summer heat watching Lantern flies plot their takeover of the human condition for a solid 45 minutes, longer than some Spanish telenovela episodes, just for one solitary taco. If that isn\'t a testament to the tantalizingly unique flavors being doled out, I don\'t know what is. The word on the cobblestone street is this place is the alchemist\'s lab of taco magic, and I will say, it\'s worth concocting your own pilgrimage for.Now, let\'s dive into the flavor showdown. Out of the five tacos we bravely embarked upon, El Sabor took home the gladiator crown. I mean, yeah, we only had a taco pachanga with five different contenders, and sure, our wallets might\'ve been lighter by a few four, five, or six-dollar bills, but these are the sacrifices one makes for taco enlightenment.The array of options at El Sabor was akin to a fiesta of diversity - a true Bacchanalian spread of toppings. However, if I may whisper a side note to the taco deities, it appeared as if the culinary arena was a bit short-staffed for a festival that was practically a Taco Olympics. More hands in the masa would\'ve been a feast for the eyes - and our growling stomachs.The kitchen crew, bless their culinary hearts, didn\'t exactly sprint in their tortilla-flipper shoes to get our orders out. It\'s as if they were savoring the suspense, like a Shakespearean soliloquy before the grand reveal. But alas, the patience was rewarded. The steak, my dear reader, boasted a flavor profile so unique it practically had its own passport.Finally, let\'s put the taco on the scales of justice, shall we? A modest 7.4 out of 10 on the "Ryan Fair Tasty Tidbit Index." It\'s a street taco that struts its own confident dance moves, but I\'m not jumping through hoops to recreate this taco memory. If you find yourself in the vicinity of one of El Sabor\'s taco havens, do indulge. It\'s a journey of flavors, like a gastronomic passport stamp you won\'t regret. But, amigo, you won\'t be crafting sonnets about it like I do - and that\'s a fact as certain as "carpe diem."', 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': 'Visited this location for lunch.

Surprisingly busy for a weekday night. We sat at the bar and had relatively quick service.I got a mezcal marg which was the drink of the day. It was pretty subpar and overwhelmingly salty which was disappointing.We ordered the fresh guac which took really really long to come out. For $15, I was expecting more guac than we got but it was tasty which was a plus. The chips were served cold which caught us off guard for a "fresh" appetizer.My partner got the fajitas which she said was good but nothing special. I ordered the Pick 2 Dinner which was a good deal. The tortilla soup was again tasty but nothing special. The burrito and enchilada didn\'t really have much flavor in my opinion. Moreso tasted the sauce on them which didn\'t really taste like much. Nothing tasted bad. It just wasn\'t anything unique or special. We\'ve definitely had better burritos and tacos and margs in town. So, I was glad that we had the Groupon to try it out but likely will not be returning.', 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': 'Good food, good service. Typical urban restaurant but noise level was high, seated back by kitchen.Great guacamole and fish taco was good!', 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "Definitely awesome food served here! There are quite a few vegan options, and a plethora of vegetarian options as well (but you'll be happy as a meat-eater too, so it's great for nearly any diet). The prices are on the high end, but the quality of the food is excellent. I ordered the Baja Burrito (protein choice of carnitas, with yuca fries and sweet plantains as sides) which was a Plato Fuerto, a tres leches, and a Pineapple Jarritos soda.I loved the burrito. There were so numerous delicious sauces served with it (3). I especially liked the slightly sweeter and creamy orange/red sauce, and it went perfectly with the yuca fries. The white sauce is very creamy and almost queso like, but still delicious. The bright red sauce is a bit spicier and more tomatoey. The burrito size is medium, so bit pricey at $16. Still. I think it's worth it. There is a fair amount of meat inside, and the carnitas were delicious and perfectly cooked. Great balance of cheese, rice, beans, and other stuffings. Not many vegetables inside, though.The tres leches was very tasty as well. A bit on the smaller side, and somewhat expensive too. It has a nice topping of whipped cream on top, and there is an adequate amount of moistness and it's overall a nice cake.The sides were simply delicious. The yuca fries were similar to French fries, but a bit more chalky in texture. They were paired well with numerous of the sauces, especially the orange one. The sweet plantains were also very good. I especially enjoyed the smaller more well looked pieces, as they tended to be sweeter. Not the best plantains I've had in Pittsburgh, but still great.The Jarritos soda is unique and refreshing. They are offered at most Mexican places, and the price is reasonable. It's made with real cane sugar, not high fructose corn syrup. These bottles require a bottle opener, though.All in all, I definitely recommend this place if you would like some high quality Mexican food in Pittsburgh. It is a fantastic place to visit if you are vegan or vegetarian (they even have a vegan pineapple coconut cake). A bit on the expensive side, but worth it!", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': 'Had a great time eating dinner here!El sabor has outdoor and indoor seating. The tables indoor are high tops and there is also bar seating. The restaurant was a little small but we had no wait when we went to eat on a Saturday night. The menu has a lot of different Mexican food options. I had the carne asada tacos Tijuana style and they were delicious! If you were indecisive, they had a dinner combination option were you could get two entrees and two sides which is nice! They also had a daily special which was the chicken tamale. The waitstaff was very friendly! Our waiter was helpful recommending different appetizers for us. We just went with chips and salsa. There were various summer drinks and we tried the watermelon margarita which was great!', 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "It was our first time here and we will definitely be coming back because it was fantastic.

I got 2 tacos of carne asada and 1 Al pastor. Delicious taste to both meats. Al pastor sometimes is hard to get the right taste and I believe this did have the taste it is supposed to have. Although I'm more of a traditional taco girl with onion and cilantro and they do not have this. The cilantro cabbage was a good topping. I would prefer if they did the double tortilla cause the taco fell apart a bit.The rice wasn't great, not much taste to it.

The food and margaritas are absolutely delicious! I had the dinner platter with veg tortilla soup, cheese enchilada, retried beans, and a tofu quesadilla. Everything's was so good but the quesadilla was the standout - the cheese & spices made it so delicious. I also have to shout out the margaritas - I'm pretty picky when it comes to margs but the taste/sweetness was absolutely perfect and didn't taste like a pre-mixed cocktail like so many do. Can't wait to go back!", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "Love this place. Our favorite mexican restaurant in town. Out of all the recommended Mexican places this was by far our favorite.

Margaritas were very tasty. My favorite was the spicy cucumber - it was very cucumber heavy, which I love. I had the fajitas and they were great.

My mezcal marg and my boyfriend's blood orange margarita were delicious! We got chips, salsa, and queso to snack on. My only complaint is that it took a very long time. We were one of the only people outside, but our waiter must have been one of the only ones for inside and outside. He apologized for the wait. Our chips and salsa came before our waters so we had to wait to eat it since the salsa was spicy. Overall we enjoyed sitting in the sun, and the drinks were great. We will definitely be back for dinner soon!", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "My 2nd time here because the food is delicious. But walking in we were seated immediately.

They said they have the food truck for the next day and wanted to check it out. But she didn't offer them drinks! They had to ask to order cocktails! The food is amazing.But this is my 2nd review about bad service. I shouldn't have to flag down my waitress to order it!There was only 5 guests and bartender is standing around .

We had decided a few weeks prior that wanted to get food from El Sabor Kitchen as their menu looked good.  Since the pandemic was still going on we decided to settle on takeout.  The person who answered the call was super polite and for dinner on this evening We decided to start off with the chips and cheese.  Then I went with a chicken chimichanga with sides of yuca fries and street corn while my wife went with the pick 2 combo and chose a chicken enchilada and a chicken plantain relleno and also chose yuca fries and street corn for her sides.  We were told that it would be ready in 15 minutes and since we were about 20 minutes away we decided to leave immediately.  Whenever I arrived our food was ready and I was able to take a quick look around the restaurant.  The restaurant was smaller than expected, probably due to the triangle shape of the building, but it had a central bar with seating throughout the rest.  It felt bright and clean and on this night it was pretty crowded inside with most of the tables being taken.  Once we got home I first dug into the chimichanga.  At this point it wasn't terribly crispy but that's on me due to time it took to get to the restaurant and home. The sauce outside it was nice and the whole burrito itself was filled mostly with chicken which was a nice surprise.  It had a good flavor but on a couple of bites I got something that I wasn't a huge fan of.  My wife also had the chicken filling and experienced the same and while I thought it tasted like cloves, which I don't like, she thought it tasted of anise.  Anyways, it was only a few of the bites and so I didn't mind it too much.  After finishing the chimichanga I tried the sides.  The street corn was nice having a lime flavor to it while the yuca itself was kind of boring.  Thankfully it came with a dipping sauce that I enjoyed due to its vinegar base.  Finally after all of that was done I tried the chips and cheese.  The cheese sauce here was a white sauce and it was quite good and flavorful.  The chips themselves were lightly salted and weren't anything special but they didn't need to be as the cheese sauce was rightfully the star.  My wife enjoyed both of her main courses and thought they were good.The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.

I was feeling something new, so we gave El Sabor Latin Kitchen a try. We were pleasantly surprised! The Mexican food scene in Pittsburgh gets better each year that I live here. Whether that\'s new places or me eating out more is up for debate... For the price of an entree, you get to pick two sides, which is a pretty solid deal. Things were fresh, and the plantains were served with this dipping sauce of sorts. It was tasty. Something cream based? Not sure - but it was sweat. Some sort of sauce came with my burrito which added a little extra flavor with each bite.The only "bad" part about our experience was the price discrepancy on the Yelp site and on their menu. We used the GrubHub ordering feature through the Yelp app and the prices didn\'t match. It was a bit of a mess, so I recommend just calling to order your food directly from the store. This isn\'t at all a swipe at El Sabor - more so Yelp and GrubHub... Get it together, you two!For a great Mexican food experience in Pittsburgh, give El Sabor a try.', 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "the food was great. i had the dinner combo. the platanos rellenos with mushrooms was out of this world. can't wait to return", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "Yes yes yes!!

I ordered the nachos and salsa dip, 3 tacos, and the tres leches cake.Nachos and dip were very good and the dip was very tasty and had a little fresh cilantro kick that made it betterTacos were good. Since they were not crowded, and seeing I was having difficulty choosing meats and toppings, Rebecca offered for me to mix them up. As a result I was able to get one chorizo, on pollo asado, and one grilled tilapia, with beans and rice, and also yucca with a dip that was very tasty.The Tres Leches cake was the best I can recall having, texture was rich and soaky but not overly sweet, and the whipped cream and cinnamon sugar went very well with it. It was nicely presented I might add..While Mexican is not my first choice for cuisine, I have to say due to Rebeccas exceptional service and nice and outgoing nature, I am giving this establishment 5 stars.

The staff were super accommodating and allowed us to keep the pup in our lap while we finished dinner inside as it poured.
