[{'review_text': 'Yes please! Coming from Denver where the Thai food was abysmal, this place delivered. The spring rolls and the pad Thai were both delicious and they actually spiced appropriately (unlike Denver). Would definitely order from here again!', 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': 'Quick, hot and tasty Thai food in South Oakland!My sister first found this restaurant on a food delivery service and her go-to order is the peanut noodles! The menu has plenty of classic Thai dishes. More variety than other local Thai eateries! I was pleasantly surprised to see the Rad Na noodle dish and had to try it! The noodles were packaged separately from the gravy on a to-go order, which was thoughtful. The gravy was packed full of veggies and had a savory flavor to it. Definitely not the most quality ingredients, but the pricing is affordable! Overall, not my favorite Thai eatery in Pittsburgh, but my meal satisfied my hunger haha. tldr;food 3.5/5service 4/5interior 4/5', 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "Very cool place! I especially love the hours and how late they are open. So if you ever feel the need to grab noodles at midnight, this is your place. And, the quality as well as prices are both quite good. I tried the pad see ew with the tofu as well as the Thai custard. Both were very tasty.The portion for the pad see ew was great. And, the flavors were as well. For $12.50, it's pretty tough to beat. They used plenty of fresh vegetables like broccoli and carrots. I enjoyed that they thoroughly cooked these vegetables since I like them slightly softer. The sauce is tasty and flavorful. The tofu is well soaked in the sauce and high quality. Very good overall.The Thai custard was also great. I ordered on Uber Eats, and there was no option for Thai custard, but I asked them to replace the mango sticky rice with the custard and they did so, so props to them for reading the note! The custard is delicious and a great texture. So is the rice. I would have liked a bit more coconut milk though.All in all, this is a great option for anyone seeking out Thai food in this area. It's a great late night meal as well. The pad see ew is great and so is the Thai custard. It's high quality Thai food.", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "I can't believe I've been at Pitt for 4 years and I just found out about this place!! I had it twice in one week after I tried it! soooo good. First time I went I got the pad see ew with spice level 1. It wasn't spicy at all but it was soooo good. Second time I went I got the rad na with spice level 2. It wasn't what I was expecting but was really good but spicy. My sister got the pad Thai with spice level 2 and she loved it. She said it was the best pad Thai she's had in Pittsburgh. We also got the summer rolls. I usually don't like summer rolls but these ones were good. My friend got the pineapple fried rice and he also said it was probably some of the best he's had in Pittsburgh. Highly highly recommend this place. So worth it.", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': 'Food was good. Delivery guy did not text or call as required and duly requested.  Got the food an hour late. Cold.', 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "It's fine. I got the pad see yew with chicken. Noodles had good flavor, veggies were good, chicken was super overcooked. My evaluation criteria for pad see yew (because I love it) is whether I think it's better than noodlehead (my fave.) This place was not, go to noodlehead instead for the same price.", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "Doesn't look like much as you come in, but truly the food was phenomenal. The food came quite quickly and came piping hot. The veggies were slightly on the more raw side and could have been left to cook for a little bit more! The fried rice was truly delectable, well seasoned and I highly recommend. As for the panang curry, I find myself somewhat an expert when it comes to this dish. I've had this dish at every Thai restaurant I've ever been (one every week for the past 10-12 years of my life) and in Thailand itself. This panang curry was truly really great, portion size was good and the veggies were really good complements to the tofu. The tofu felt a little over cooked (it was chewier than normal). Can easily feed two-three people. **Warning, they top this dish with peanuts Pad Kee Mao is a great substitute for aversive rice eaters. Well cooked and well seasoned noodles! Dinging a point only because the interior was dirty, music was really loud and hard to talk over, and service was a little less than hospitable!

Greatest drunk food spot in Oakland. Only reason I don\'t give it 5 stars is that it can sure take a while sometimes, and the staff are not always overly friendly. However, this place has NEVER let me down. Totally recommend after a night out with your friends. Ask for the "cry hot", they don\'t advertise it, but if you like some kick this is the way to go!!', 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': 'I just ordered and got the pineapple fried rice with extra pork, nothing is seasoned, not even with salt, very disappointed. The pork looks like mush and tastes the', 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "Was it the best Thai I've ever had? No, but they were still open after midnight on a Saturday and that did it for me.  You Pittsburghians better cherish this place because I've never been anywhere where there was Thai food open this late. I ordered from Uber eats so the price was a bit steeper. We got pad Thai tofu, kee mao tofu, red curry tofu, papaya salad, and crispy chicken special. Spice level was a 2 but it was the perfect spice for us.Pad thai - 3/5 I've had better and was a bit on the sweeter sideKee mao - 4/5 I really liked all the vegetables, wished it had more of a smokier taste like I'm used to but was still goodRed curry - 5/5 one of the best red curry I've ever had, wished it had Thai eggplant thoughPapaya salad -2/5 I didn't like it, was too sweet for me Crispy chicken - 2/5 was what I was expecting and wasn't worth it for me. Overall this place was good for a drunk night in. If it wasn't opened this late it would've been a 3.5/5, but I would have eaten here again regardless.", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "I ordered their crispy duck pad Thai and butterfly shrimp this time and was slightly disappointed. The duck wasn't crispy and it didn't have a lot of flavor to it. The pad Thai was ok. Probably won't get it again. The butterfly shrimps were good. I like that it was so meaty. I ordered through Uber this time, and it was still hot when it got here. Overall, I wasn't impressed with the food. I will try something else next time since I really liked them the first time.", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "I ordered pad Thai and I give 3 star because:Negative points on way over-priced item with the half-priced overall food performance. Chicken is dry and I can tell it's added at the last minute. Too much noodle and too little on other ingredients. Taste normal or impressive. Positive points: decent portion and fresh ingredients (even though not much)Worth trying once but I won't come back.", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "If you're from Pittsburgh, I'm sure you know of Noodlehead as one of the best Thai restaurants. I was excited to see a Thai restaurant open on Pitts campus (south Oakland)! I was ready to compare it with one of my fave Thai places. I got the roasted Pork noodle soup and my bf got the Pad Kee Mao which he always gets at noodlehead. He LOVED his dish and got a 4/5 spice. It really tasted good IMO as well and similar size to noodlehead! My soup was REALLY spicy when I asked for 2/5. The broth and noodles were good but the pork was cold. The service was a bit slow since they seemed a bit understaffed but they were all friendly! We are definitely coming back because they have a much bigger menu than Noodlehead and the prices are similar!

The food was super fresh and tasty - very authentic. The woman running the place was wonderful.', 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': 'We ordered delivery through Yelp/Grubhub, and the delivery came much earlier than expected. We ordered the chicken bang bang, crispy duck pad Thai, special fried rice. The meal also came with two extra fried spring rolls that were free. The chicken bang bang was the best with the actually outstanding mayonnaise sauce. For the crispy duck pad Thai, the pad Thai itself was pretty good, however the crispy duck was very dry, some parts inedible due to this. The special fried rice was fine, with crispy chicken in the fried rice that could have been more crispy but it tasted fine. We appreciated the free spring rolls and that the food was still hot when it arrived.', 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': 'ordered orange chicken, what I received tasted like tomato chicken.

When we arrived, we could hear (what I imagine is the owner) in the back cooking away. We tried to get her attention but she didn't hear us. We grabbed menus and decided what we wanted to eat, and then after about 5-10 minutes, we resorted to calling the restaurant to tell her we were inside and ready to order! Lol but once she realized, she promptly came out with water and ready to take our order. I got the mixed vegetables with tofu entree, and my friend got lo mein with a mixture of beef and shrimp. The tofu was amazing - crispy outside and soft inside. I also got a generous portion of rice which was cooked perfectly. She asked both of us what our desired heat levels were from 1-5 : I said 3 and he said 4. I kind of regretted going so high as I'm not a big spice fan, but aside from a runny nose, the heat level was yummy and not overpowering. The heat was perfect for the dish and went well with the flavors; not just a pepper bomb smacking you in the face. It was cold inside the restaurant, and it doesn't have the most comfortable seating, but it otherwise was nice, with simple decor and televisions playing Christmas specials.The price was more than a takeout Chinese spot (a little over $25 for two entrees), but it was so delicious, the flavor was elevated, and it was cooked quick and fresh - we could hear our meals being prepared just behind the wall in the restaurant! I think the food is well worth the price.During our time there, we were the only dine-in customers; though there were quite a few Grubhub pickups so it is a popular place, just maybe not for dine-in on a weekday. I would definitely come back, especially with the hookah bar next door!

I order the Pad See Ew or the Pad Thai and I've never been unhappy with either! Sometimes I'll get the steamed pork dumplings but I end up being way too full because their portions are large!

I generally like my food spicy  and also full of flavor and  this is was a home run.  This is a quaint,  likely family owned, business. So be patient with the service.  They seem to have a lot of  "to go" orders, which keeps this place busy.  The only negative is the spring roll and my standards are probably unrealistic and I I have a hard time recommending this appetizer. However everything else makes up for it!!  5 stars!!
