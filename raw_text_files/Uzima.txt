[{'review_text': 'This business replaced the old Salud Juicery in Oakland! But they are still serving quality acai bowls, smoothies and juices. So don\'t worry!I ordered the "Purpose" acai bowl, which was a classic acai bowl with peanut butter and topped with fresh fruits and granola. The quality of the fruits and smoothie bowl were great! No complaints there. However an acai bowl averages about $10+ for a standard portion! Parking is scarce in Oakland, so that might be tricky. The store\'s atmosphere is calming and inspirational. Lots of positive quotes from the owners and customers alike. Unique wall art fills the space. tldr;food 4/5service 4/5interior 4/5', 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': 'Uzima is a total vibe! I was blown away when I walked into this establishment. This is a black owned establishment. The owner is great, he was engaging with every customer and took the time to talk to people.  Your able to purchase juices, smoothies and açaí bowls. What I like most about this business is it promotes mental health, and the depression cloud wall that people can write on is so uplifting.', 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "This. Place. ROCKS.The smoothies they have here are so rich and flavorful. All the other people who were in there with me today agreed, and they even said so. The price is just right on everything they offer, yet I think you get way more than what you actually pay for. I haven't had the pleasure of trying an açaí bowl yet, but it's next on my list! But it's the mission of this place that really makes it a rare gem here in Oakland. I was greeted by one of the owners, Mayan, when I first walked in. He told me about the different options available and even gave me a sample from the smoothie he made for the last guest. He told me all about their goal as a business to create a safe space where people can talk about mental illness, and you can see it in all of the surrounding decor. He was so warm and welcoming that I felt as though we had been lifelong friends! He was like that with everyone who came in, which just enhanced that overall safe haven-feeling! Even the drinks and bowls themselves are named after things like love and hope for those struggling with mental illness. I absolutely love this. These guys certainly have my full support!", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': 'What an inspirational smoothie establishment very close to Carlow university. We were looking for something cold and refreshing after being outdoors on a super hot and humid day. The staff was friendly and super helpful explaining our options.

I enjoyed the vanilla sky and cherry which was delicious and flavorful.', 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "Amazing hidden gem.

I think it is a little too sweet for my liking but I like the acai options they have. Their fruit is ripe and delicious. I don't love the granola though. I love how they have sorbet too, I will have to try that next time! They offer smoothies, juices, and health shots as well. Love that they have fun with their product names!", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': 'Joyful people serving amazing smoothies.
