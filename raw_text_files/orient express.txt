[{'review_text': "Husband loves this place! after graduating from college for 10+ years , this is what he missed the most. He probably ate 500 meals here over the 4 years. The 5 star comes from him rather than myself. I would probably rate 4 stars instead of 5. This was my first eating here, I would say among all the American Chinese place I've been, this still have really good American Chinese dishes. We ordered house fired noodle, orange chicken, salt and pepper pork, egg plant with garlic sauce. The eggplant was my favorite however house fried noodle and pork chop were both very delicious as well. Orange chicken had a little too much batter and not enough chicken, but the flavoring was good. After so many years, their food is still very reasonably priced. Hope they'll stay strong.", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "I stopped in here to grab lunch with a friend before leaving for Chicago for Thanksgiving! I love the food here at Orient Express, and you get a decent amount of food for the price! I went with the Eggplant in Garlic Sauce with Shrimp and a Teriyaki Chicken Skewer. I also opted for white recipe to soak up all of the garlic sauce! Everything was so delicious: the chicken skew was super tender and flavorful, the eggplant and shrimp were cooked perfect, and it was all smothered in a delicious garlic sauce. My friend got the general tso chicken with a chicken skewer as well! He loved his, and there wasn't a grain of rice on either of our plates.

We got the garlic chicken, hunan tofu, sweet and sour chicken and beef Lomein. Everything was actually pretty decent for Americanized Chinese food standard. Sure it wasn't great and was loaded with salt, grease and most likely MSG but the food came out super quick, hot and may I add, cheap. It was a win for us. Tips: they have quiet a few tables for indoor dining and also a to go sauce bar with chili oil that was delicious.", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "The place was clean. HOWEVER, worst Chinese food I have had in my entire life. I ordered dumplings and wonton soup- 2 very basic things. The dumplings were SO soggy I wanted to throw up. The wonton soup was just straight up bland. They didn't even have crispy noodles for the soup. Also, their lunch menu goes from 11-3. I just finished work around 2:40 and placed an order at the time. I sat down and started eating, and only after the fact I ordered they told me I had to leave in 15 minutes so they could take their break. I was rushed and every five minutes this crass woman came back to remind me. I ended up leaving unfulfilled.", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': 'Shirley the goat. Great restaurant. Go here.

The Mongolian beef is just a search for a piece of meat along the onion forest, and the Hunan Beef is a jumbalaya of veggies you don't want to eat.Convenience is what makes this place, but the dishes are really subpar, even for takeout Chinese food.", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "If you are looking for fast, cheap option for Asian food--this is a very convenient option if you're on or near CMU's campus.

Although it is not fine dining by any measure, the noodles and teriyaki chicken were both very good. Additionally, the portion size was generous (I came hungry and left very full) and my meal cost less than $10. Also, my order was ready in less than 5 minutes.

Their tofu is nice and crispy and the general tso's sauce has a nice garlic flavor. The chicken skewer was good too. Overall, can't complain as the prices are very reasonable and food is good.

I love the salty, eggy white sauce that smothers the shrimp, mushrooms, snow peas and crunchy water chestnuts. There were at least a dozen medium-sized, succulent shrimp in an order, so it is a good value too. My dinner companion enjoyed the shrimp in egg. It is a little greasy to have as a meal, but it is nice to share.It's hard to rate this place because I really enjoy what I get there but think other dishes are just average. The four stars are for the shrimp in lobster sauce, not exactly the restaurant overall. My expectations for service and ambiance aren't high for a restaurant in Oakland. It's a solid, quick lunch and dinner spot.", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "We saw this place across from the museum and decided to give it a try.

Every other dish I've tried on the menu (which to be fair isn't that much...but still!) has been very lacking. On top of that, service here is so bizarre.

We actually already had dinner earlier and then went to a prescreening hosted at Carnegie Mellon. It got pretty late, dark, cold and we turned into hungry wolves. I was excited to pop in here for my second dinner. I ordered some appetizers to split and the food and sauces were great.

No complaints!', 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "Craig Street prides itself on being full of slightly over-priced takeout options geared towards the students, faculty, and staff of CMU.  Orient Express fits in just fine here, although I probably wouldn't stop in unless I was at CMU.First, the lunch deals are the reason to come here.  I have never actually gotten the lunch deal, but it's an absurdly good deal.  I think it's $6.75 for a meal, rice, and spring roll or something like that.  You cannot beat it.I ordered safe when I came here and got Shrimp Lo Mein ($8.55 w tax).  It was really mild and lacked many veggies.  The shrimp was OK, but I would order something else if I returned.  The meal was pretty lackluster, but the takeout was super fast.All in all, Orient Express will fill the void in your stomach, but there are better Chinese options in Oakland.", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "Nicely flavored food but...I wanted to try a few of my go to foods to see if I would want to eat here again. My complaint would be that everything I ordered that had dough or batter had alot of it! I was literally peeling batter off of my Salt and Pepper shrimp which was a bummer because that's where all of the seasoning was but I couldn't taste the shrimp through all of the batter. Same thing with the pork dumplings and wonton soup, I had to cut off alot of the extra thick dough to be able to taste anything but super thick wonton dough. I'm not sure if they were having an off day or if you can request something to be lightly battered and I wouldn't say they're bad because everything was well seasoned and flavorful I'm just not a fan of the thick coating they use on everything.", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "Three of my friends and I came here for a quick dinner in between studying and it was ok. As most people are saying, it's pretty standard American Chinese food. We thought the Malaysian satay chicken dish we ordered would have more of a peanut sauce flavor, but it looked and tasted different from other Malaysian satay chicken dishes I've had before. Tasted ok though. The eggplant dish was good, as were the Singapore noodles. The price was reasonable, since the portions were pretty large and we were doing it family style. I liked that the food came fairly quickly and it was close to CMU's campus, so we could do a quick meal. I'd go back, but only if I was under a time crunch and needed somewhere close by and quick. It was great though that they had no problem splitting the check for us and we were all able to pay separately with credit cards.", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': 'I didnt like the Singapore friend rice once, but I liked it the second time.

Their food is mediocre (usually covered in sauce), and the wait staff always seem unfriendly.  However, one upside is that they bring the food out very quickly (usually within 5-10 minutes of ordering), so we just guessed that they have all the ingredients ready on hand and then when an order comes it, just put it in the wok and saute away.  Their bubble tea isn't very good here because 1) it's made from powder mix and 2) their bubbles (boba) are soooo hard, I think they never defrost the tapioca or something. Bleh. A good place to go for quick cheap eats especially if you're a Pitt/CMU student, but if you want quality food, definitely go somewhere else.", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': 'Used to be a fan of their Singaporean fried rice!!', 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "Orient Express serves pretty typical Americanized Chinese food. So while the food isn't mind-blowingly delicious, it's perfectly acceptable for a filling lunch.I ordered the eggplant over rice (with pork) lunch special and mango boba tea. The eggplant and pork was served with an excess of sauce and oil, so I found it rather greasy, but the overall taste was fine. Not too salty and the eggplant was nice and chewy. It was also just the right spiciness level.I thought the boba tea was too sweet, and the boba pearls were disappointingly mushy, but it was very inexpensive compared to other places. So hey, what can I expect.I ordered my food to-go so I can't really comment on customer service, but the workers seemed nice. They were very polite to me.Overall, reasonable prices and okay food. I may come back at some point.", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "Americanized Chinese food. OK price, OK quality, interesting staff here. Either totally empty or extremely crowded with Chinese graduate students. Here's the good thing, it's basically on campus for CMU students. So pretty convenient as an alternative to the God-forsaken Asiana (a horrible CMU dining place).I tried half of their menu. Hot pot is my favorite. Not the traditional Chinese family style hotpot but rather a pot of fishball-veggie-meat-shrimp mixture. Caution: MSG. Fried rice is decent. All the signature Americanized Chinese food are made as they are supposed to be: a little Chinese appearance with the American taste.

About as average as you can get although I will certainly say I've had better Chinese fare elsewhere. It's probably the closest Chinese place you can get to CMU or even Pitt otherwise. Good for takeout or even for groups. The food is okay ... not particularly mind-blowing but also not bad either. Oily tends to be how I'd describe most food, also not really sure how the cooks are able to get the food out so fast (sketchy, maybe?). Standard Chinese fare ... the Meal Specials are soft on most wallets. Do not get the bubble tea here ... it is indeed quite subpar in terms of tea quality and boba quality (terrible). Bahn Mi & Ti and Fuku are much better places to go for that", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "The important part about coming here is to realize what this place is good for - a large quantity of food that's quick and cheap and is great for those take-out days when you the college student are overloaded with work and just don't have time to deal with another place. Keeping that in mind, I don't worry about the service quality or authenticity of the food or anything like that. When I come here all I care is that I get my food quickly and that it tastes reasonably good. OE definitely has both of those qualities. Whether I order orange chicken or General Tso's or lo mein or chow fun - the food always comes out quickly and always hits the spot.As a bonus, it's pretty close to CMU campus and definitely better than the Asian options there. If I were still a student, I would definitely keep coming back here for my Chinese take out!", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "I'll eat here again since it is so close to CMU. I wouldn't go out of my way to get here, though. I ordered via phone so I could go in and get out. Nope. They gave me chicken instead of tofu. I had to wait an extra 10 minutes (maybe not that long) but it was annoying since i called in so I could get the food and head back out.The food was GREAT. It was very reasonably priced and the portion was large. I could get two servings out of it. They also did not go light on the vegetables--something other places don't do! The veggies were fresh too, not that frozen, barely thawed stuff.", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': 'Quick and consistent Asian fair.

I recently came back during CMU Carnival, and it still has not changed. Service is still super quick, the restaurant is no-frills but relatively clean, prices are still rock bottom and my favorite dishes were still exactly how I liked them. $6 lunch specials still? Seems like inflation didn't really hit them too hard. Hard to beat this kind of value.That said, you have to know what to order here. Some of their dishes are better than others. I usually go with the salt and pepper pork chop, Singapore mi fun, string beans, salt fish chicken fried rice, and beef noodle soup. Again, the food comes out super fast, so you have to wonder if they're keeping it behind doors with heat lamps or something, but regardless, it doesn't taste like it.I would recommend against the bubble tea here, as the bubbles are a bit harder than most other bubble tea places around. Go to the Rose Tea Cafe across the street, or even Lulu's for better bubble tea. Or just get the tea without the bubbles and you should be okay.Quick, cheap, relatively high quality Chinese food at a convenient location? Look no further than OE.", 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': 'Orient Express serves no nonsense affordable American Chinese food. The decor is pleasant and clean, and the prices are reasonable. The food is also quick and pretty good. Oh and they have really nice plastic takeout containers.I really like the dumplings and the string beans with beef, and the hot pots are always pleasant surprises. A particularly standout attribute of Orient Express is that all the dishes seem to come with a lot of vegetables, which is uncommon amongst American Chinese restaurants and I think separates good from bad Chinese food. While you\'re not going to find the most "authentic" Chinese food at the Orient Express, the Americanized Chinese food they serve is pretty darn good. And if you can\'t enjoy a good General Tso\'s Chicken because it isn\'t "authentic" - something is wrong with you (and maybe you can have an aneurism at the thought that General Tso\'s has been exported back to the old country and is being served in Taiwan). The owner, Peter, is a really good guy and isn\'t above taking orders, cleaning tables, and is almost always at the restaurant. During my student days, sometimes we needed catering for student events, and Peter was always reasonable and willing to work within your budget.', 'review_rating': None}, {'review_text': "I am very disappointed with the dishonesty of the restaurant. My friends and I went to the place the other day. The total price for each person is 7.3 ~ish. We give ~15% tip and authorized the payment of ~$9 from my card. However, my friend told me yesterday that his credit card was charged 11.34 instead of 9. I checked my credit card statement and found the same thing.

Having lived in Charles Village in Baltimore, one of the most notoriously terrible places to seek chinese food was at a place named "Orient Express"2. I was craving BBQ Pork, and based on the different non-socal places that I\'ve tried, most of these bbq porks would serve a better purpose being adhered to the sole of a shoe to improve its sping factor.Having bad connotations with this restaurant name, however, I tried it per the recommendation of a new friend of mine who had been living in the area for a few years already. We went at 9 o\'clock one thursday night after class, and the restaurant  was serving 4 other tables.  My friends ordered MaPo Tofu, extra spicy, and I ordered a BBQ Pork Noodle Soup.I am quite delighted to say that despite their suspiciously brief time to crank out dishes faster than water could boil on an induction stove (a striking similarity to the old orient express i had been to as well), the bbq pork was one of the most tender pieces i have ever had outside of the freshly made bbq pork at Sam Woo Restaurant back in San Gabriel, CA! It was most definitely a pleasant surprise.  The rest of the dish consisted of thicker ramen-type noodles and a few leaves of bok choy.  My friends\' mapo tofu didn\'t quite look like mapo tofu to me, but they enjoyed it anyhow.I hope to come back sometime for lunch, when the deals are even better!

Nothing in particular on the menu stands out to me, and I tend to avoid their greasy MSG-filled food if I can, but credit has to be given to their service catered toward university students.

That said, it is strange to me how nearly every time the meal is brought out within 10 minutes (5 if you're taking it to go, especially the lunch specials). I try not to think about how much of the food has already been pre-made in the kitchen.For a sit-down meal, the place is nice in that it usually is not too loud, and there are always available tables; the place is never overbooked.

First of all... the lights were not off. It was dim. It was our first time going after sunset. We thought it was mood lighting.

It's hard to feel ripped off, especially given the amazing convenience.3) The experience is consistent.

It gave me a headache and a dry mouth.Now comes the Shanghai lo mein. It seems to be no different from the regular lo mein. It was a mistake to order it with fried rice since it made everything super greasy. After finishing the soup, I barely ate any of the main course before asking the waiter to have it boxed.

Tons of reasonably decent-quality food served lightning-fast for cheap.  It's basically the Chinese-food equivalent of a diner (only cleaner than your average dive, with Enya or some other Celtic-lite music in the background).The waiters are not particularly friendly--though having observed them chatting with Chinese patrons, I suspect they mostly don't speak much English.  But that's ok--decide what you want and tell them, and they'll go away; take a friend or a book and you won't even notice.  (Why is gruffness a good thing in waitresses at dive diners but bad in staff at a dive Chinese place?)This place is *fast*.  Whether I've come at 5pm on a Saturday or 1230 on a weekday, the food is on the table within 15 minutes, sometimes half that.  (They won't hold your dish while they finish your tablemates', though; if something takes a while, you could almost finish before your friend gets to eat.

I\'m going to time how long it takes for the entrees to come out today and update my status.I always get the General Tso\'s Fried tofu with fried rice and hot and sour soup.  It\'s fantastic.

You order at the front and the waiters are only responsible for bringing your food out to you and refilling your drink.

For good or bad, I\'ve been to this place plenty of times, and I\'ve made it a game to time how long it takes me to get my order as soon as I\'ve placed the order. My record: 1 minute and 47 seconds. Some may be joyous about this time, others repulsed, and I think being both joyous and repulsed simultaneously is more or less what you\'ll actually be feeling when you enter, eat, and leave OE.And maybe OE was able to put my food on the table so quickly because they already knew my order as soon as I walked through that pointless ten-square-foot vestibule that is the OE entrance: Yeung Chow Fried Rice. The Yeung Chow Fried Rice is likely your best bet - at $6.95 and two-meals-worth of fried rice (egg, peas, and carrots) with shrimp, chicken, and BBQ pork, it\'s the clear winner when it comes to filling your stomach tastily and cheaply.To conclude: OE has WiFi.
